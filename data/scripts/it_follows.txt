EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - NIGHT 1
ANNIE (20) stumbles out the front door of her parent's
lakeside home. She's in her pajamas, - wearing red pumps. She
moves with urgency and a primal fear.
She looks back as she runs, turning onto the street.
We hear the screen door open and close again.
Annie slows down, a few houses down. She stops and turns
towards her home, standing in the center of the street.
Street lamps and oak trees line the block.
It's quiet. Annie stares ahead - seeing something - she
starts to back up.
One step. Then another. Click of heels on concrete.
Slowly, tracking backwards, Annie remains focused on something
- fearful. We see nothing.
Nearby, a young couple, pulling groceries from their car
notice Annie walking in the street. The WOMAN steps towards
the sidewalk - concerned.
WOMAN
Hey, are you ok?

Annie nods to the woman, but remains focused on something
else.

WOMAN
You need some help?
ANNIE

No.

The woman shrugs to her husband and turns away.
Annie turns - aware of something closing in. She continues
stepping backwards.
A door opens. ANNIE'S FATHER steps onto his front porch,
frazzled. He looks around and sees Annie in the street.

ANNIE'S FATHER
Annie! What are you doing?

Annie looks to her dad, then back to the street - continuing
to move away.

ANNIE
I'm fine, dad.

(CONTINUED)

ANNIE'S FATHER
Where are you going?
ANNIE

Nowhere.

Annie looks back to her dad and the open door. She sprints
forward, rounding her imagined chaser.
Annie races across the lawn towards her father.

ANNIE'S FATHER
What the hell, Annie?

She hops onto the porch, flashes a smile to her dad and runs
into the house. Confused, her father follows her.
It's quiet again outside. The couple carry their groceries
inside.
Moments later, Annie runs out the front door, keys in hand - a
purse over her shoulder.
She sidesteps across the porch and climbs into her car.
Starting the engine, Annie speeds away as her father runs
outside once more.
2 INT. ANNIE'S CAR - NIGHT 2
Annie drives down a dark street - with wild abandon.
The radio is on.
Her cell phone rings from inside her purse on the passenger
seat.
3 EXT. LAKE ST. CLAIRE - NIGHT 3
Annie's car is parked at the edge of a beach. The driver's
side door is open. The headlights are on.
Near the water, Annie sits alone in the wet sand, facing the
car.
A ring tone chimes - muffled through the cloth of her purse.
She stares. Focused. Terrified.
Annie looks ahead at the shadow-filled horizon of sand. Late
night mist flows across the beams of her car headlights.
Reaching into her bag, Annie grabs her cell phone and presses
a button. She's nearly crying as she holds the phone to her
ear.

2.
1 CONTINUED: 1

(CONTINUED)

ANNIE

Dad? Hi. I love you...

She listens - watching her surroundings. The water continues
to splash lightly behind her.
ANNIE

I know. I know. I just wanted you
and mom to know how much I love you.

Annie stares ahead. We see her point-of-view - headlights
beaming down across the sand, illuminating her footprints. The
dark trees shift and sway.
We hold on this frame, even as Annie continues to speak...

ANNIE

I'm sorry I can be such a shit to you
sometimes. I don't know why I do
that. Just know that I love you, ok?
I just really... love you both...

3A EXT. LAKE ST CLAIRE - MORNING 3A
A hard-cut reveals...
Harsh morning sunlight on the sand and lake. Peaceful sounds.
Annie is laying along the shore. Her body is pale and still.
She's dead. Her jaw hangs open - head slumped to the side.
Blue lips and face - covered with bug bites. Her leg is
twisted back - violently rotated in its socket - a piece of
bone visible near the knee’s twisted skin. Her red pump
dangles from her foot, over her chest. Legs open. Something
awful and provocative.
Water or something viscous has soaked her pajama bottoms,
creating a small wet circle in the sand near her waist.
A seagull pulls at a piece of skin near her toes.
Cutting back to the now familiar POV shot facing the car and
the trees, we see two young kids looking at the body. A sister
and her younger brother. They stand, looking down - almost
frozen by the sight. The little boy holds a kite in his hands.
In the sunlight, it might be possible to distinguish Annie’s
footsteps leading down from her open car door, the children’s
footsteps leading up to their current position, and a third
set of footprints at the far left of frame. This third set
leads up to Annie and then recedes back into the treeline.
The waves continue to roll.

4 EXT. JAY'S BACKYARD - DAY 4
JAIME "JAY" HEIGHT, a pretty 19 year old girl, relaxes in her
hot tub - sipping a cola. Droplets of sweat dot her cheeks and
forehead.
A breeze pushes a swarm of white dandelion seeds through the
air, swirling past the young woman's face.
Jay stares up at a couple of birds hopping along the telephone
wire overhead. She smiles as they hop and peck - sharing some
food.
A squirrel races along the wire causing the birds to fly away.
Jay looks down - stretching her arms out in the hot water.
She looks at her hands and legs immersed in bubbles. The
bright sun reflects against the surface.
Something irritates her shoulder. Jay turns her head and looks
at her upper arm just above the water. She sees a tiny red ant
moving toward her elbow.
She watches it closely for a moment, then lowers her arm into
the water, dispelling the tiny insect in a swirl.
The glass door slides open - KELLY, Jay's 17-year-old sister,
leans out from the doorway in her summer clothes - it’s an
Indian Summer.

KELLY

Hey Jay.
JAY
What's up?
KELLY

Nothing. Paul and Yara are here.
We're gonna watch a movie if you feel
like it?
JAY

Thanks, I'm going out actually.

KELLY
That guy?
JAY

Yeah.

Kelly swings a bit - hanging onto the door handle. She flips
her hair up with a goofy smile and looks to her sister.

KELLY
I like him.

4.

(CONTINUED)

JAY
Yeah me too.

Kelly steps inside and slides the door half-shut.
Across the backyard fence, Jay notices movement in the
neighboring yard.
Looking closely, she sees two pairs of eyes peeking out from a

pile of lumber. The NEIGHBOR BOYS spy on her through the chain-
link fence. A couple dumb little kids - ages 8 and 11.

Jay gives them a dirty look and points.

JAY
I see you.

The boys duck down out of view.
JAY

Don't you have a video game to play or
an animal to torture?

Jay slides deeper into the tub. She holds her mouth just
above the surface of the water.
5 INT. JAY'S HOUSE - DAY 5
Jay walks inside, wrapped in a towel, her hair wet.
In the adjoining living room, Kelly sits with her friends
watching a bad comedy. They're sprawled across the furniture.
On tv: a man talks with his English-speaking dog about the
woman he loves. The dog offers bad romantic advice.
PAUL, 17, eats cheese curls on the lounge chair.
YARA, 17, is slumped into the couch cushions with her legs
across the coffee table; a pair or glasses on her nose. She
reads an ebook on her pink-shell-compact smartphone, still
managing to laugh at the television.
Jay stops alongside Kelly and watches a moment of the movie.
Jay smiles and waves to Yara, who glances up just long enough
to see who's around.
JAY

What are you reading?
YARA
The Idiot.

5.
4 CONTINUED: 4

(CONTINUED)

JAY
Is it good?
YARA

I don't know yet. It's about Paul.
Paul makes a face toward Yara - irritated.
Jay leans over the couch, letting water drip onto her sister's
face. Kelly swats her away.
PAUL
Hey Jay.
JAY
(smiling at the bunch)
Hey Paul.

MRS. HEIGHT, Jay's mom, drinks wine and smokes in the dining
room - chatting on the telephone. Laughing.

MRS HEIGHT
(into phone)
Oh no I'd love to. That sounds fun.
I could come over and cook for you if
you'd like. I make a really delicious
quiche. Do you like quiche?

The woman continues to flirt and smile through the telephone
receiver. For a mother, she is awkward and shy.
Without looking up, Yara mumbles a statement over the hokey
music of the movie.

YARA

Hey, I have an idea...

PAUL

What?

Yara casually farts, staring down at her telephone screen.

YARA
Oh... it got away.

Kelly and Paul laugh and grimace as Yara grins like a child.
She scrolls and swipes, reading the novel on her phone.
Jay raises her brow and heads for the hallway.
Paul turns and glances at Jay as she walks away - eyeing the
older girl.
Yara and Kelly notice him staring at Jay. They smile to each
other - aware that he's love-struck and hopeless.

6.
5 CONTINUED: 5

6 INT. JAY'S BEDROOM - DAY 6
Jay adjusts her blouse in the mirror. She looks at herself -
admiring and critiquing.
Leaning close to her reflection, she puts on her make-up.
A polaroid on the mirror shows her drinking a beer with Paul
at a dark indoor swimming pool - much younger.
Dirty clothes hang from chairs or sit in piles along the
floor. Old dolls boxed in a corner. A scuffed and dirty
yearbook. Things covered in dust - all bathed in the green &
orange haze of summer light through curtains and a nearly
imperceptible post-adolescent mist.
Jay moves a lock of hair across her forehead - finessing its
placement - being picky.
She laughs at herself and blows a gust of air up - causing her
bangs to flip.
From across the room we watch the rest of the scene:
Jay walks to her dresser and grabs a pill bottle from atop it.
She opens the plastic container, pops out a pill and swallows
it. No water necessary.
Jay sets the bottle down and re-examines her outfit and shoes
in the mirror.
A pose - how does my ass look? Ok.
A coy glance at herself. A funny bug-eyed face. A raspberry
from buzzed lips and exhaled air.
We hear a deep rumbling as the camera pushes in towards the
mirror, moving tightly on Jay's lips as she covers them in
dark pink lipstick.
7 EXT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY 7
Jay stands alongside her date, HUGH (21), waiting in a long
line to buy tickets. They stand under the marquee, looking
out at the street and the passing crowds.
Hugh has a look of contentment on his face. The couple kiss.
A woman behind them glares and makes a face - jealous and
irritated by their public affection. They don't notice - only
us.

JAY

You ever play the "trade game"?

7.

(CONTINUED)

HUGH
No. What is it?
JAY

It's a people watching game. My
sister and I used to play it when we
were bored.
HUGH
(teasing)
You're bored right now?

Jay smiles and shakes her head in playful frustration.

JAY
(stern but loving)
No. Shut up. Let me finish.

HUGH

Alright, how do we play?

JAY

OK. You start by watching the crowd -
casually scope out the people around
us.

Hugh turns and looks at the people at the rear of the line -
then toward a group near the lobby.

HUGH

Ok.

JAY

Now without telling me, pick one
person that you'd like to trade places
with. It could be anybody. For
whatever reason.

Hugh nods and scans the crowd. Jay does the same.

HUGH
Ok. I got one.
JAY

So now I get 2 guesses to figure out
who you picked and why you want to
trade places with 'em.

HUGH
Alright. Good luck.

Jay looks around the crowds of people on the street. She
zeroes in on a very large man with a long beard.

8.
7 CONTINUED: 7

(CONTINUED)

JAY

Him.

Jay giggles and points casually at the big man. Hugh looks
and laughs, shaking his head.
HUGH

No.

JAY

You could pick up cars and throw them
if you were that guy.
HUGH

Yeah, but he's not my pick.

7A INT. MOVIE THEATER LOBBY - DAY 7A
Waiting in line for popcorn with Hugh, Jay looks around the
elegant lobby. She notices a well dressed, good looking guy
talking to a hot blonde in a short dress.

JAY
That guy.
Hugh shakes his head - no.
JAY

I figured you'd wanna sleep with the
hot blonde.
HUGH

Nope. She's not even cute.

Jay rolls her eyes. Hugh is clearly lying about the woman's
attractiveness.

JAY

Ok. Who was your trade?

Hugh looks over at a couple standing by the stairs with their
little boy - feeding him movie theater junk food.

HUGH

Him.

JAY
The dad?
HUGH

No. The son. How cool would it be to
have your whole life ahead of you?

Jay shrugs - thinking about it.

9.
7 CONTINUED: (2) 7

(CONTINUED)

JAY

Come on. It's not like you're an old
man. You're 21.
HUGH

I know. But look how happy that kid
is. Plus, at that age you can go to
the bathroom anytime you want. Total
freedom.
JAY

Yes, he's probably taking a shit right
now.

HUGH

Exactly. I could never get away with
that.

Jay shakes her head and smiles.
7B INT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY 7B
With popcorn and drinks in hand, Jay and Hugh take their
seats. Jay starts to scope out the theater and nearby patrons.
The organist plays an overture.
JAY
Ok. My turn.

Jay looks around, turning back to see the rear of the theater.

JAY
I got mine.

Hugh smiles as he eyes the surrounding crowd - enjoying the
game. Jay watches with anticipation.

HUGH

How about the girl in the yellow
dress?

JAY

Where?

HUGH

There.

JAY

Uh... I don't see her.

HUGH
Right there.

10.
7A CONTINUED: 7A

(CONTINUED)

Jay stares - confused - she sees no one - same as the
audience. Hugh points at an empty space near the curtained
entrance.
There is NO girl in a yellow dress - anywhere.

JAY
Are you teasing me?

Hugh looks at his date and begins to realize she's not
kidding. His face changes. He stares back at the walkway -
focused on something or someone unseen by us.

JAY

Hugh, I'm sorry I just don't know who
you're talking about, but that's not
who I picked...
Jay's smile starts to fade.
HUGH
I'm sorry.
JAY
No. What's wrong?

Hugh glances back quickly, starting to stand up.

HUGH

I don't think I feel like watching a
movie.

JAY

Why? What's going on?

Hugh sets his drink down. Jay stares at him, looking for an
explanation.

HUGH

I don't feel good all of a sudden.

Hugh is fidgeting - sweaty.
JAY

Oh. Well we don't have to watch the
movie. You need to go home?

Hugh turns his head and looks to the back of the theater. He
stares. Jay notices but doesn't say anything.

HUGH

Um, let's just go to the car.

JAY

Ok.

11.
7B CONTINUED: 7B

(CONTINUED)

Hugh takes Jay’s hand and leads her to the side exit,
shuffling past movie-goers as they step into the sunlight.
8 EXT. CITY STREET - DUSK 8
Jay walks with Hugh towards the parking lot. She notices him
glancing back - looking for something. His demeanor has
changed. Something is wrong.
JAY

Did you see somebody that made you
wanna leave?
Hugh shakes his head.
JAY

Like an ex-girlfriend or something?
You said there was a girl in a yellow
dress. Was it someone you knew?

HUGH

No. I just felt sick. I feel better
being outside.

9 INT. '67 FORD GALAXY - DUSK 9
Jay sits next to Hugh. He drives the car down the highway -
silent.
Jay turns from Hugh and stares ahead. She buckles her seat
belt and watches the road - unsettled.

10 INT. RESTAURANT - EVENING 10
Jay sits across from Hugh in a cozy booth, looking out at the
street through a large window.
They're eating Italian food.
Jay smiles and leans forward, cat-like, stealing a sip from
Hugh’s wide glass of beer.
Hugh glances outside. Jay touches his hand. A moment of
flirting.
Through a slow zoom, we move past the couple, focusing on the
distant intersection of pedestrians outside the window. Tiny,
but visible, a poor working class family walk together along
the sidewalk. The kids have ice cream. The parents smoke
heavily. A tall and very thin man crosses the road, moving
toward the restaurant - he coughs and hacks into his forearm.
12.
7B CONTINUED: (2) 7B

11 INT. '67 FORD GALAXY - NIGHT 11
Hugh's car is parked on the street near Jay's house. The pair
are making out passionately.
Mid-kiss, Hugh peeks out the window, looking into the dark
night.
Jay pulls away from the kiss and reaches for Hugh's pants
zipper. He gently guides her away.

HUGH
I want to, but...

Jay looks at Hugh - worried that she did something wrong.

HUGH

My stomach... still...
Jay gets it. She smiles and nods.

JAY

Ok.

HUGH
I'll see you soon?
JAY

Yeah.

HUGH

Bye.

JAY

Bye.

Jay climbs out and jogs up to her front porch, pulling out her
keys. Hugh drives off with a wave.
12 INT. JAY'S CAR - MORNING 12
Jay drives her car along the crowded I-75 expressway - into
the city. Detroit is grey and flat.
A radio DJ comments on the Indian Summer.
13 EXT. WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY CAMPUS - MORNING 13
With backpack over shoulder, Jay walks along the half empty
path. Campus buildings loom. Old architecture resting on
broken sidewalks.

13.

14 INT. STUDENT CENTER - DAY 14
Jay eats fast food alone at a table. She watches other
students pass through the large modern corridor.
Jay chews and looks down at her drink. A paper cup. A
plastic lid. A straw.
The chatter mixes together into a blur of voices.
15 EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - DAY 15
A LITTLE GIRL on a distant porch covers her eyes and counts to
10. Her friends run and scatter behind bushes and garbage
cans.

LITTLE GIRL

7...8...9...10... here I come!

A bunch of LITTLE KIDS are playing FREEZE TAG on a distant
front lawn. They scream and laugh as they run from each other.
Once tagged, they stand frozen, until someone else crawls
under their legs and frees them.
Jay walks with Kelly down the sidewalk, drinking Slurpees -
They pass by the children's game in progress.
Kelly pulls out a pack of cigarettes and lights one. She
takes a drag.

KELLY

Thanks for walking with me.
The two girls step leisurely down the block.

JAY
Mom knows you smoke.
KELLY

Yeah, but she'll cry if she actually
sees it happening.
JAY

Or she'll steal your cigarettes.

Kelly shakes her head.
Jay takes a sip from her drink. She looks out at the green
lawns and clean suburban stretch ahead of her.

KELLY

How's it going with Hugh?

14.

(CONTINUED)

JAY

Good. Mostly. He was acting kind of
weird last night.
KELLY

Why?

JAY

I don't know. He said he wasn't
feeling good, but it seemed like
something was on his mind.
Kelly exhales - stepping down the street.

KELLY
Have you... um...?
Jay looks at her sister.
JAY

No. I know he wants to... but last
night... he seemed different.
Kelly starts to laugh at her sister.

KELLY
(teasing dryly)
Maybe he's a virgin?
JAY

He's not. I mean, I don't know for a
fact, but... no.
KELLY
So what's the problem?

JAY
I don't know.

An old woman approaches, walking her dog. The girls pet the
animal as it passes.

OLD WOMAN
(looking at her dog)
She loves the attention.

JAY

Yeah.

The woman walks on and the girls resume their journey home.

JAY
You're still... ?

15.
15 CONTINUED: 15

(CONTINUED)

KELLY

Me?
Jay nods.

JAY
You haven't... ?

Kelly looks at Jay - then finally understands what she's
getting at.

KELLY

I haven't slept with anybody. Not for
any real big reason or anything. I
will... eventually. Maybe soon. Any
minute now.
JAY
Whenever.
KELLY

Yeah.

JAY
What about Paul?
KELLY

Ehhh. We kissed once and it didn't
feel right. He's more like a
brother... although he's kind of in
love with you. So I don't know what
that means.

Jay smiles and thinks about it for a moment.

JAY

It'd be like fucking my step-brother.

Kelly starts to laugh.
KELLY

Gross.

The two sisters smile and share a laugh.
They pass before a modest house with a pristine lawn. A
fighting couple - possibly a girl mid-tantrum - can be heard
inside. We see Jay's POV as she stares at the brick ranch
home, passing it slowly. She shakes it off and continues down
the suburban block. The yelling fades.
Kelly takes a final drag, then tosses her cigarette into the
street.

16.
15 CONTINUED: (2) 15

(CONTINUED)

KELLY
Do I smell bad?

Jay leans over and smells her younger sister.

JAY

You smell like cherry coke, banana
nicotine.
KELLY

That's my favorite flavor.

JAY
Mom's gonna love it.

Kelly slurps her drink - making a funny sound through the
straw. Jay smiles - walking through her sunny neighborhood -
looking around at the street she grew up on.

JAY

It's weird still being here. It’s
like... everybody else went away to
school, but me.
KELLY

Dad said he'd pay for you to go away.

JAY

I'm not sure I even want to. It's all
kind of useless isn't it? I mean,
degrees don't get people jobs. At
least not good ones. Look at mom.

KELLY

Then why are you even taking classes,
dumb-ass?

Nearing their own house, Jay notices a very HANDSOME young man
washing his car in a driveway across the street. GREG
HANNIGAN, 21, sees them. He waves casually - without a smile.

JAY

She won't let me stay here if I don't.

Kelly waves back. Jay simply nods to him - walking along -
avoiding too much eye contact.
KELLY

When I graduate, I'm getting the hell
outta here. I wanna go to college
somewhere that doesn't have shitty
weather.
JAY
Ok. I'll visit.

17.
15 CONTINUED: (3) 15

(CONTINUED)

Greg resumes his car washing, watching Jay as she nears her
front porch. He seems very focused on the young woman.
16 EXT. WOODS - NIGHT 16
Hugh holds Jay's hand, leading her down a dark path into the
woods. A six pack dangles from his thumb. Still visible, the
car headlights shine through the trees. Moonlight casts a
soft glow over the area.
Hugh carries a small bag over his shoulder.

JAY

Where are you leading me?

Hugh turns and shushes her nicely - a finger to his lips.
Jay smiles and keeps walking, sticking close to her date.
They move deeper and deeper into the dark and foreboding
forest.
A bird calls from a craggy and deadened tree. Jay peers into
the dark as something scampers by.
Hugh looks around as he walks - always turning and watching.
17 EXT. WOODS AND LAKE - NIGHT 17
Towels hang from an old log near a small lake - black and calm
in the night - surrounded by trees.
Hugh kicks off his boxers and wades into the water, gulping
his beer. He smiles looking back at Jay. She steps to the
edge of the lake, happy and excited, though shyly covering her
chest as she takes off her clothes.
Jay grabs her beer from the mud and walks into the water,
joining Hugh. She laughs as she steps deeper.

JAY

The bottom feels gross.

HUGH

It's better over here.

Jay reaches Hugh and he pulls her closer, kissing her.
Hugh watches the woods, while making out with the girl. His
eyes are focused.

HUGH
Maybe we shouldn't.

18.
15 CONTINUED: (4) 15

(CONTINUED)

JAY
I want to.
HUGH
Me too, I just...
JAY
You like me?
HUGH

I do.

Jay kisses him harder, pressing closer - it's getting heavy.
Hugh pulls back and looks around, watching the trees and the
clearing.

JAY

What? Nobody's here.

Hugh nods. She's right, but he keeps scanning the woods.
Peeking around. Jay watches him - puzzled and ready - she
raises her brow.

JAY
Let's go to the car.

More kissing.

HUGH

Yeah?

JAY

Yeah.

Hugh nods as he rubs his hands over Jay's back. She moves
with him - their energy and tension increasing.
18 INT. '67 FORD GALAXY - NIGHT 18
Jay has a bead of sweat along her forehead. She holds her
arms tightly around Hugh in the back seat of the car.

Jay breathes heavily, her body pulsing from very recent semi-
aerobic activity. Their clothes sit in a pile along the floor

of the car.
A tiny smile crosses her face as she sits resting on Hugh's
lap. They breath in unison. Rising and falling together.
Jay grins as she kisses Hugh's ear.
Hugh looks ahead with cold and frightened eyes. Something is
on his mind. Something isn't right. He hides his face
amongst Jay's post-coital affection.

19.
17 CONTINUED: 17

19 EXT. DARK LOT - NIGHT 19
The old Ford sits at the back of a dark, dirt lot. Woods and
an old factory surround the car. We watch from a distance as
faint silhouettes move within the vehicle.
One of the back doors opens and Hugh climbs out, pulling up
his boxers. He walks around the car and opens the trunk.
Partially obscured, we wait as he attends to something at the
back of the car.
The clinking of bottles and junk. The sound of a beer can
opening.

JAY

It's funny, I used to daydream about
being old enough to go on dates and
drive around with friends in their
cars.

Some viewers might notice the absence of a license plate.
20 INT. '67 FORD GALAXY - NIGHT 20
Jay lays across the length of the back seat, resting on her
stomach. She kicks her heels up playfully as she pokes her
head out the open door.
We hear the trunk close. The sound of footsteps.

JAY

I had this image of myself holding
hands with a really cute guy,
listening to music on the radio and
driving along a pretty road... maybe
somewhere up north... after the trees
started to change color.

Opening the opposite rear door, Hugh crawls inside the car,
laying across Jay. He kisses the back of her neck. Caresses
the side of her bare waist.
Jay grins as Hugh kisses her. She rests her cheek on the
leather seat. Deep and slow breaths.

JAY

It was never about going anywhere...
just having some kind of freedom I
guess. Now we're old enough, but where
the hell do we go right?
Then with force and quickness -

20.

(CONTINUED)

Hugh pushes a small cloth over Jay's mouth. She tries to move
away, but he holds her head down until her eyes close. She
stops struggling.
Jay rests quietly again - a cheek on the leather seat. A half
open mouth. A drop of drool. A long and deep breath.
Darkness.
The sound of wood being dragged across a concrete floor.
A metal door closes.
Footsteps. Breathing.
Jay slowly opens her eyes.
21 INT. ABANDONED FACTORY - NIGHT 21
Jay looks around the old factory floor. A giant open space
lit dimly by moonlight and distant street-lamps. Several
stories up, treetops line the windows.
Hugh walks along the far edge of the space, waving a
flashlight out windows and down long running hallways.
Jay half-focuses her eyes. She takes a few deep breaths.
The girl is drowsy - still under the chemical spell of an
inhaled narcotic.
Looking down, Jay sees her arms and legs tied tightly to a
wheelchair. She squirms and pulls but she can't move. Her
body isn't fully responsive.
Hugh looks back from across the warehouse floor.

HUGH
Jay? Are you awake?

Jay stares across the darkness at Hugh as he slowly walks
over. She tugs lightly against the rope and cloth bonds. Her
eyes sag within their sockets.
Hugh stops in front of her. He leans down and looks at her
face. He looks frightened. His eyes are watery. His face is
red - like he's been crying.
HUGH
I'm sorry.

Jay tries to talk. Drool edges out the crease of her mouth.

JAY

Whuuuttt aarrhhh youuhhh doingggggg?

21.
20 CONTINUED: 20

(CONTINUED)

HUGH

I'm not gonna hurt you. Don't worry.

Jay stares at him with deep fear.
Hugh turns and shines his flashlight into the darkness. He
scans the room. Jay watches.
She opens her mouth as if to yell, but it's nothing but a
hollow gasp - a mimic of a dry heave.
Hugh shushes her with a gesture and continues waving the beam
of light around the warehouse.
HUGH

You won't believe me, but I need you
to remember what I'm saying.

Jay stares in fright.
HUGH

OK?
Jay nods her head - ok.
HUGH
This thing...

Hugh looks around the room slowly.
HUGH

...It's gonna follow you.

Jay eyes Hugh with growing concern. This is getting worse.
Hugh points his light towards a distant doorway. It's empty.
Jay pulls against her ties - trying to get free.

JAY
(with a gasp)
Hellllppppppp.

Hugh turns and looks at Jay's pretty face.

HUGH

Somebody gave it to me. I passed it
to you... back in the car.

Jay's eyes widen - terrified.
HUGH

It can look like people you know... or
it can be a stranger in a crowd...
whatever helps it get close to you.

22.
21 CONTINUED: 21

(CONTINUED)

Sometimes I think it looks like people
you love just to hurt you... scare
you... make fun of you.

Hugh stands up and rushes to a nearby window. He aims his
light outside towards the ground.
HUGH
I see it.

Jay cranes her neck up trying to look out the far-off window.
She sees nothing.
Hugh runs over and wheels Jay's chair towards the window. Jay
looks out and down towards the adjacent field. It's dark, but
she catches a glimpse of a middle-aged, naked woman slowly
walking around the corner of the building.
Jay's eyes show fear and shock.
JAY
Whhhoooo isss??

Hugh wheels Jay back to the center of the room.

HUGH

You can get rid of it. Sleep with
someone else as soon as you can. Just
pass it on. If it gets you, it'll come
after me... you understand?

JAY

No.
Jay starts to cry.
Hugh shushes her.
The room is quiet.
Hugh looks around - listening.
They wait - longer still.
We see Jay's eyes in close-up as she watches. We see her
point-of-view: empty halls and dark doorways.
Nothing still.
Then...
There's a shuffling sound from a distant hallway. Hugh points
his light into the darkness.

23.
21 CONTINUED: (2) 21

HUGH (cont'd)

(CONTINUED)

Jay cries in silence, looking towards the beam of light at the
far end of the warehouse.
Finally...
A naked middle-aged woman emerges from the very distant
shadows - slowly walking.
Jay watches - puzzled and scared.
JAY

Whooo isszzz atttehh?

The naked woman, still far away, creeps along staring at Jay.

JAY

Whudddda fucckk d'youu wannnttt???

The woman contorts the muscles in her mouth - oddly -
revealing teeth and tongue. She continues walking forward.
Jay cringes and looks to Hugh.
HUGH

Jay, I'm doing this to help you... so
you know it's real.

Hugh points his flashlight at the woman as he circles closer
to her.
Hugh stands along the edge of the woman's path, waving
slightly in her direction. She doesn't look at him - only at
Jay.
Jay shakes in her chair, pulling at her restraints. She
stares up at the naked woman - still over 50 feet away.

JAY
Ehhhhh. Noooo...

The middle-aged woman opens her mouth again, straining the
muscles in her throat.
JAY
Huuughhhhh!

Another step closer. And another.
Hugh runs across the room and spins the wheelchair around. He
pushes Jay down the darkened hall as the nude woman follows
behind.
Jay stares ahead in shock - passing rotting walls and rusted
industrial equipment.

24.
21 CONTINUED: (3) 21

(CONTINUED)

HUGH

Never go anywhere that doesn't have
more than one way out. It's very
slow, but it's not dumb.

Jay looks down at her bare legs and the passing floor. Her
eyes are heavy.
22 EXT. DARK LOT - NIGHT 22
Tires kick up dirt.
From a distance, we watch as the old Ford swerves around the
corner and drives off down the road - racing away from the
abandoned building.
23 EXT. JAY'S HOUSE - NIGHT 23
Kelly sits on the stoop of her front porch with her
neighborhood friends. They're playing 'Old Maid'. Paul pours
liquor from his flask into a Coke can. Yara reads from her
pink-shell-compact cell phone while sorting her hand of cards.

KELLY
Can I have some?
PAUL

Yeah.

Paul hands Kelly the can of pop. She takes a sip and cringes
from the taste. Gross.
Kelly shakes off the sting of cheap booze and examines her
cards. She holds the old maid card - unfortunately.
She tries to maintain her poker face while looking back at
Paul.

YARA
(reading from her cell
phone)
Listen to this... “I think that if one
is faced by inevitable destruction --
if a house is falling upon you, for
instance -- one must feel a great
longing to sit down, close one's eyes
and wait, come what may . . .”

KELLY

That's why we're drinking on the
porch.

Paul grins and looks over at Kelly. Yara mutters a fake laugh.
25.
21 CONTINUED: (4) 21

(CONTINUED)

PAUL

Your mom asleep already?

KELLY

Almost for sure. Yeah. She wakes up
at 5:15. I think that would kill me.

We push in slowly towards Kelly's hand of cards - centered on
the Old Maid - an ugly caricature of a spinster.

PAUL
Yeah that's rough.
YARA

I never wanna have a job.

Yara's eyes dart excitedly over her cell phone screen. She
smiles and nods to herself - enjoying some undisclosed prose.

KELLY
I wish I didn't.
PAUL

You love serving hot dogs and ice
cream to weird old people and crying
children.
KELLY

Ok. That's true. It brings me joy.

Yara rolls her eyes at Kelly's goofiness.

YARA
Where's Jay at?
KELLY
Oh. On a date

This bit of information seems to sting Paul. He covers it as
much as possible. Kelly looks to him, holding up her hand of
cards.

KELLY
Your turn.
YARA
Who is he?
KELLY
Somebody new.
PAUL
Of course.

26.
23 CONTINUED: 23

(CONTINUED)

Kelly gives Paul a dirty look as he grabs a card - the old
maid remains in her hand.
YARA

Your sister is so pretty. It's
annoying.
KELLY
It is annoying.
PAUL
At least she's nice.

Yara gives Paul a dirty look. He smirks back and she kicks
him in the leg.
The old Ford Galaxy races up the street and stops in front of
the house. Kelly and her friends turn and watch as Hugh runs
out and opens the back door on the far side of the car. The
engine is still running.
Kelly and her friends watch as Hugh pulls something from the
backseat. Kelly begins to stand.
KELLY
Is everything ok?!

Hugh closes the rear door, stepping over something as he runs
back toward the driver's seat.
HUGH
(pointing back at the
ground)
Don't let it touch you!

Slamming his door shut, Hugh drives off, revealing Jay in the
middle of the road. Still tied and bound in her underwear, she
crawls toward the curb - trying to walk.

KELLY

Jay!

Kelly drops her cards and jumps from the porch - confused.
Jay tries to stand up and move closer to the outer sidewalk -
she fails - falling in the grass.
Kelly rushes across the front lawn toward her sister. Paul
and Yara follow behind.
24 INT. HANNIGAN'S KITCHEN - NIGHT 24
GREG, Jay's handsome neighbor, pulls a beer from the fridge
and rounds the hallway.

27.
23 CONTINUED: (2) 23

(CONTINUED)

Wearing sweat pants and a ragged t-shirt, he takes a sip as he
approaches the front door. His hair is a mess - styled by
pillow.
His mother, MRS. HANNIGAN, peeks through the screen door -
flashing police lights shine through the front curtains of her
home. Greg joins her, looking out at the street scene: a
series of police cars, an ambulance and an assortment of
people.
Jay sits on her porch, covered in a blanket, surrounded by
emergency workers. Her mother, in a robe, talks with a police
officer near the garage.
The other kids mill about the property as neighbors peek and
pass by. There's a mist in the night air, covering the
suburban lawn.
Greg and his mother watch. The young man sips his beer.
Through the screen, Greg sees Jay talking with the cops.

GREG
What happened?

MRS. HANNIGAN

I don't know.

Greg watches the scene - the glare of ambulance lights. His
face shows concern.

MRS. HANNIGAN
Those people are such a mess.
Greg stares ahead - ignoring his mother.
25 EXT. JAY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 25
Jay is mid-conversation with a police officer. She sits,
covered in her blanket, looking across at the man.

POLICE OFFICER
It was consentual?

Jay nods her head.

JAY

Yeah.

Jay looks back at the policeman - her eyes are tired and sad.

POLICE OFFICER

And you'd never seen the woman before?

28.
24 CONTINUED: 24

(CONTINUED)

JAY

No.

Jay shakes her head and touches her legs - focusing on her
fingers stretched across her bare knees - losing herself in
thought.

POLICE OFFICER

Ok. Have you ever been to his home?

JAY

Not inside, but I know where it is. I
waited in the car for him once. He
didn't want me to come in. He said he
was embarrassed about where he lived.

The cop nods as he writes in his notebook.
26 INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT 26
Jay is in an emergency room partition.
A doctor examines her - performing a test for STDs.
Jay lays there - sad and still. Her breathing is loud and deep
- each inhalation shown in labored slow-motion. Pronounced
anxiety through Jay's eyes.
The camera begins to shake as it pushes towards the bed. A
hollow rumble fills the soundscape...
27 INT. JAY'S DINING ROOM - MORNING 27
Mrs. Hannigan drinks coffee at the table across from Jay's
mom. Mrs. Height takes her time pouring some sugar into her
own coffee. She mixes in some Irish liquor and takes a sip.
There's a long sigh after the drink.
MRS. HANNIGAN

She didn't catch anything did she?

MRS HEIGHT
They don't think so.
MRS. HANNIGAN

Poor Jaime.

MRS. HEIGHT

Apparently he used a fake name to rent
a house in the city. The police
searched the place, but they can't
find him.

MRS. HANNIGAN

My god.

29.
25 CONTINUED: 25

(CONTINUED)

MRS HEIGHT

It breaks my heart. The things he
said to her. So weird and sick.

Mrs. Hannigan shakes her head in sadness as she drinks more
coffee - looking around the room at the wall of family photos:
Jay and Kelly smile brightly in front of wooded backdrops in
childhood portraits.
In one faded picture, young Jay smiles awkwardly, leaning on

her grandfather's shoulder - peaking at camera. The old red-
haired man grins alongside Jay's mother and father.

28 EXT. JAY'S HOUSE - MORNING 28
The storm door is open. The wind rustles the trees.
29 EXT. JAY'S SUBURBAN STREET - MORNING 29
The neighborhood is quiet and mostly empty. Birds chirp. A
car passes near the main road.
30 EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - MORNING 30
Beyond the trees of the middle-class suburban neighborhood,
the concrete towers of a nuclear power plant are visible in
the distance.
31 EXT. SUBURBAN PARK - MORNING 31
A few kids laugh and play near a jungle-gym. A small boy sits
on the swings.
32 EXT. ICE CREAM STAND - MORNING 32
The ice cream stand appears empty.
33 EXT. ABANDONED FACTORY - MORNING 33
A police car is parked in the dirt lot. The abandoned
building sits within the quiet field. Two police officers
walk calmly along the grounds. One examines the discarded
wheel chair lying sideways in the grass.
34 EXT. JAY'S HOUSE - DUSK 34
The sky is a dark purple. The house is closed up and quiet.
The trees sway.
35 INT. JAY'S BEDROOM - DUSK 35
Jay rests in her bed. The wind blows steadily against the
window.

30.
27 CONTINUED: 27

(CONTINUED)

A glass of juice and a plate of untouched food sit on her side
table - a pickle, Doritos and a white bread, crust-cut
sandwich. There's a pill in the center of the napkin.
36 INT. JAY'S BATHROOM - MORNING 36
Jay stares at her body in the mirror - looking down as she
lifts the top edge of her underwear. She inspects herself.
Did I catch something?
Shallow breathing - from fear. Examining under the bright
light.
A terrible rumbling begins. The bass and reverberations fill
the room... Jay looks down.
Dirty clothes hang from chairs and shower bars.
The sun shines through the bathroom window. A large patch of
negative space sits between Jay and the glass.
Is something outside?
The open bathroom door looks into the bedroom. Mirrors
suggest empty space and shadows - things out of view.
We wait for something to emerge.
Smash!!!
Jay jumps from fear as a ball thumps against the bathroom
window.
Taking a moment, she walks slowly towards the window.
Jay peeks outside and sees a ball sitting in the grass below.
No one is visible outside.
37 EXT. JAY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 37
We see a reverse shot of the neighbor boy hiding beneath the
window sill. He peeks back inside - covertly staring at Jay as
she walks to the sink and drinks straight from the faucet.
She's stooped and shaken, lapping at the water.
The rumbling resumes - growing and doubling - feeding back on
itself.
38 EXT. WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY CAMPUS - MORNING 38
Jay walks along the main path with her backpack - staring at
the edges for something unknown.

31.
35 CONTINUED: 35

(CONTINUED)

Her POV tracking forward - a half-barren campus.
Jay steps ahead. Nervous and cautious.
The old buildings cast shadows overhead. A homeless man lays
quietly on the ground - peeking at the pretty girl.
Jay sees a woman walking towards her on the path. Slow -
possibly handicapped or a survivor of a stroke.
Jay watches her out of the corner of her eye - the female
student passes.
39 INT. COLLEGE CLASSROOM - MORNING 39
A man lectures at the front of the class. Chalk marks fill
the board, along with the printed notation of "Fall Semester
Sociology".
20 or so young adults sit throughout the room at desks and
chairs - shorts and t-shirts fail to fend off the humidity.
Jay writes notes by pencil at the far edge of the classroom.
The large windows to her right show the adjacent square.
Jay bites on the edge of her pencil as she stares out at the
campus. The heat is visible.
Sweat forms on her skin. She fans herself with a book.
Greg sits on the opposite side of the classroom - near the
back. He glances over at Jay - watching her with concern and
curiosity.
Students walk lazily along the pathways near the square. Jay
watches them walk. The teacher's voice fades from her ears.
A few people relax on blankets in the grass - sharing food and
talking.
Jay sees an OLD WOMAN IN PAJAMAS walking very slowly -
emerging from behind a row of trees. She focuses on the woman
as she hobbles along.
The old lady steps directly across the blankets of studying
students, passing between couples without notice. She stares
with her mouth open, looking directly at Jay.
Jay takes a breath and watches with frightened eyes.
The old woman walks closer and closer to the building, moving
past some shrubs - approaching the windows.
Jay tenses up. She stands awkwardly, grabs her bag and walks
out of the classroom.

32.
38 CONTINUED: 38

(CONTINUED)

TEACHER
Uh, Jay, are you...?

Jay closes the door without a word. Greg looks out to the
hallway with concern.

TEACHER
OK. Well...

40 INT. MAIN COLLEGE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 40
The heavy door opens a crack. Jay peeks out - just an eye.
She sees a few college students chatting together near the end
of the hall. An administrator pushes an AV cart out of a
nearby classroom.
Jay opens the door the rest of the way and steps into the
hall. She looks around as she makes her way down the long
passage.
She eyes classes in session.
Jay runs her hand along the wall. A few more steps onward.
Far off - at the opposite end of the hall - Jay sees the old
woman walk very slowly into view.
Jay swallows hard as her breathing quickens. She watches with
curiosity and fear as the old woman stares ahead and moves
closer.
Jay stops and waits.
The CHATTING STUDENTS, a few girls laughing and gossiping in
the middle of the hall, fail to notice as the old woman walks
straight through their semi-circle.
Jay stares, puzzled over the lack of attention to the old
woman in pajamas.
Though still far off, the old woman keeps coming closer.

JAY

Hello?

The old woman doesn't respond.
One of the chatting girls turns back and looks at Jay - giving
her a funny look. Do I know you?
CHATTING GIRL

Hello?

Jay says nothing in reply. She fixates on the old woman.
33.
39 CONTINUED: 39

(CONTINUED)

The chatting girl shrugs and laughs, turning back to her
friends.
The old woman moves closer with crippled steps - mouth agape.
Scared, Jay turns and runs out the nearby exit doors.
41 INT. JAY'S CAR - MORNING 41
Jay drives her tiny economy car through levels of the parking
structure. Descending, the camera reveals row after row of
cars - students with backpacks - empty spaces - shadows.
Jay appears tense and on-guard as she steers.
42 EXT. DETROIT ZOO - DAY 42
Jay walks past the Rackham "Bear" Fountain - kids throw
pennies into the copper water. We follow behind her. She
appears nervous - keeping her distance from others - scanning
the crowds.
To her right, lions sprawl across the floor of their den.
Giraffes step through the Egyptian exhibit as Jay crosses the
nearby walkway.
42A EXT. CONCESSION STAND - DAY 42A
Jay walks up to a large concession stand where Kelly and Paul
are working.

In uniform, Kelly serves cups of cola and hotdogs to zoo-
goers. Near the counter with supplies in hand, Paul notices

Jay, and stops.

PAUL

Hey, what are you doing here?

JAY

I need to talk to my sister.

Paul rests the food package against the counter. He sees the
look of anxiety on Jay's face.
PAUL

You ok?
JAY
Uh huh.

Jay nods but she doesn't convince him.

34.
40 CONTINUED: 40

(CONTINUED)

PAUL

We're both taking a break in a few
minutes. If you want to sit down and
wait...

Kelly works feverishly in the background.

JAY

Ok.

Jay looks around at the passers-by. Her neck and eyes betray
her nervous energy and bird-like jitters.
Paul pulls his damp uniform away from his chest in an attempt
to feel some sort of breeze.
PAUL
So hot out, isn't it?

JAY

Yeah.

Jay has sweat on her forehead and arms, but she seems
unaffected.

PAUL
Want some ice cream?

Jay looks back at the young man and nods. She really would.

JAY
Thank you.

43 INT. POLAR BEAR AQUARIUM - DAY 43
Sitting in the underwater tunnel, Jay leans against the glass,
rubs her temples and holds her face as she tries to relax.
Paul and Kelly watch alongside her.
KELLY
Jay, what's going on?

JAY

There was an old woman at school
today. She was staring at me... it
seemed like she was following me.

Jay stares down the tunnel at a group of strangers. Eyeing
them carefully.
Kelly tries to hide her worried face.

PAUL
Did you know her?

35.
42A CONTINUED: 42A

(CONTINUED)

JAY

No, but she freaked me out. I didn't
even go back to class.

A few children in silhouette stare through the glass at the
swimming polar bears. They shuffle along in awe.

KELLY

Did she say something to you?

Jay shakes her head. She looks down at the ice cream in her
lap. She nibbles on the dessert as her sister and friend watch
with quiet concern. They exchange a look between one another.

JAY

Hugh told me that he passed it onto
me. That something was gonna follow
me.

The light from the water adds a pulsing shimmer to her face.

KELLY

That's all bullshit, Jaime.

Jay looks up at her sister and stares back with wide eyes.

JAY
Yeah, I know.

An enormous polar bear swims overhead - a passing shadow.

PAUL

What exactly is supposed to be
following you?

Kelly glares at Paul - don't encourage this.

JAY
I don't know.
KELLY

You should tell mom what you saw.

JAY

No.

KELLY

Well, Jay, I'm worried about you.

Jay focuses on her ice cream. Small delicate bites. Kelly
watches her older sister pick at the dessert with a spoon,
like a young child - shoulders pointing inward.
We see the trio together from outside the tunnel, through the
blue icy water.

36.
43 CONTINUED: 43

(CONTINUED)

The surface is visible just above, with pristine white glacial
walls behind them. Jay's figure appears stretched and
distorted through the calm water.
For this moment we hear only the pulsing of water within a
reverberating tank.

KELLY
We gotta get back.

Paul nods and Jay begins to rise from her stooped and
sheltered position.
PAUL

I could stay over tonight if it would
make you feel better.

Jay and Kelly simultaneously glance in Paul's direction.

JAY & KELLY
(together)
No.
Paul shrugs.

PAUL

Like on the couch or something.

KELLY

No.

Jay considers for a moment.
JAY
Maybe on the couch.

Kelly rolls her eyes as Paul grins from a minor victory.

KELLY

You should be more worried about
waking up and finding Paul humping
your leg.
JAY
That's true.
PAUL

Um...
The girls laugh.

PAUL

I'm choosing to ignore these insults
to my character...

37.
43 CONTINUED: (2) 43

(CONTINUED)

KELLY
(to Jay)
Just keep your door locked.

Jay nods, finishing her ice cream with a small grin.

PAUL

I will stay up all night and keep an
eye out for anything weird. Nothing's
gonna happen. OK?

Jay looks up at Paul and her sister - exhaling a light breath.
44 INT. JAY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT 44
Yara sits on the toilet in her pajamas clipping her toenails
while chewing on a red vine. She appears focused.
Jay and Kelly brush their teeth in front of the sink, laughing
to each other in the mirror. Kelly wears her old and tattered
Amanda B’s Dance Team shirt.
With toothpaste filled mouths...
KELLY
Mom just went to bed.

JAY

Did she say anything?
KELLY

No. She saw Paul on the couch. I
don't think she cared. She had her
bottle of merlot.

Jay nods - understanding the subtext. More tooth-brushing...

JAY

I keep thinking that something must be
wrong with me. Even right now, it
feels like I'm ten feet away from
myself. The walls seem far away. I
don't even like looking across the
room. I feel... overwhelmed.

Yara continues clipping, tapping her nail-tool against the rim
of a tiny waste basket.
YARA
(matter of fact)
It's probably anxiety.

JAY
Will it go away?

38.
43 CONTINUED: (3) 43

(CONTINUED)

Yara nods - chewing more licorice.
KELLY

But it can really fuck with you if you
let it. So... don't.

Jay spits into the sink.
45 EXT. JAY'S HOUSE - NIGHT 45
The night is quiet. A few lights remain on inside the house.
46 EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - NIGHT 46
An empty and dark street. No cars pass. Most households are
asleep.
Static shots of dark alleys, sickly oak trees, backyards
illuminated by security lights.
Rusted chain link fences.
A dirty above-ground pool. Water sloshes gently through an
intermittent filter.
47 INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 47
On the television, a monster roars and a woman screams.
Paul sits on the couch watching a black and white horror film.
Blankets and pillows cover the couch. He eats popcorn and
candy in the dim room.
There's tinny gunfire from the television. Alien sounds
reverberate.
Paul tosses some more popcorn in his mouth as the on-screen
hero embraces the damsel in distress. *
The woman on the tv cries and kisses the hero. Paul slumps *
into his pillow with a sigh.
48 INT. KELLY'S ROOM - NIGHT 48
Kelly sleeps soundly in her bed. Yara is awake in her sleeping
bag, reading Dostoyevsky via cell phone.
The monster movie can be heard faintly.
Through Kelly's window, we see the outer yard. It's mostly
dark and very still. We hold on the window - moving closer to
it - watching - waiting...

39.
44 CONTINUED: 44

49 INT. MRS. HEIGHT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 49
Jay's mom is asleep on her bed. She's sprawled across the
crumpled comforter in her night robe.
A bottle of wine and empty glass sit on the dresser.
50 INT. JAY'S ROOM - NIGHT 50
Changing into bedtime clothes, Jay glances out her window.
Across the alley, she sees the 11 year old neighbor boy spying
on her from his bedroom window.
Jay jumps out of surprise. She covers herself and pulls the
blinds down as the neighbor boy hides behind his own curtains.
Bothered and momentarily frightened, Jay sits on the floor
next to the window, listening to the television echo from the
hallway.
51 INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 51
We follow behind Jay as she carries her blanket and pillow
down the hallway into the living room.
Still awake and watching a midnight movie, Paul sits up and *
fixes his hair as the pretty girl plops down on the smaller
love-seat across from him.
JAY

I can't sleep - not in there.

PAUL

That's ok. Sleep here.

Jay smiles and pulls the covers over herself.
They sit together - quiet - watching the television.

PAUL
You really ok?

Jay pauses - then looks at Paul. She shrugs her shoulders.

PAUL

Everything's gonna be cool.

Jay nods her head. On the television, several soldiers lure a *
giant monster into an electrical trap. *

PAUL

It's funny, I haven't spent the night
over here since we were kids.

40.

(CONTINUED)

JAY

There's a reason for that.

The pair crack smiles.
PAUL

Shut up. I'm serious. It's cool to
spend time with you.
JAY

Yeah.

PAUL

We used to hang out all the time.
Remember?

Jay nods. *

PAUL

At some point, it must've been weird
for you having a guy friend that was
younger than you.
JAY

I don't know. I think we just grew
apart, right? Or you and Kelly got
close. It's not a big deal, is it?

PAUL

No. Not a big deal. *
On the tv, a soldier flips a switch and sends a giant arc of *
electricity into the towering monster. *

JAY

You were my first kiss, you know.

PAUL

I know.
JAY
Was I not yours?
PAUL

No. You were. *

JAY

And you kissed Kelly. She told me.
You kissed two sisters... that's kind
of gross.

Paul grins. *
The monster in the movie shrinks and disappears under the *
electrical charge. *
41.
51 CONTINUED: 51

PAUL

Do you remember that time we found all
the porno magazines in the alley by
Barry's Pizza?
JAY

Yes.

Jay shakes her head with a smile - silly memories. *

PAUL

We were such stupid kids.

JAY

Ridiculous. *

PAUL

We're all sitting on Greg's front lawn
with a dozen dirty magazines sprawled
everywhere and we're laughing...

Jay chuckles at the memory.
JAY

We had no idea how terrible it was.

Paul starts to laugh. *

PAUL

And Greg's mom?! Remember her face
when she came outside and saw us all
sitting around reading that shit?

Jay laughs along with Paul. *

JAY

She scooped them up so fast. Called
my mom too. Me and Kelly got a sex ed
lecture the next day.
PAUL

I got one too. *
Jay and Paul smile to each other from across the room. *
They hear the sound of glass breaking.

PAUL
What the fuck?
Paul stares at Jay - worried.
JAY
Go look.

42.
51 CONTINUED: (2) 51

(CONTINUED)

Paul hesitates. He jumps up and steps to the edge of the room
- trying to determine where it came from.
Jay watches, scared, behind the covers on the love-seat.
Paul turns the corner, exiting the living room.
Jay waits.
Heroic and celebratory music pours from the tv as the credits *
roll. *
Jay scans the room - the windows.
A moment later, Paul returns. He stands at the corner of the
large room.

PAUL

There's a broken window in the
kitchen, but nobody's there.

JAY

Are you sure? You looked around?

PAUL

Yes.

Jay doesn't appear comforted.
PAUL

Whoever broke it ran away.

JAY

We should call the police.

PAUL

I'm gonna wake up your sister. She
should probably call.

JAY

OK.

Paul steps out of view - heading for Kelly's room.

PAUL
(O.S.)
I'm surprised they slept through that.

JAY
(speaking to no one)
Yeah.

Jay sits alone on the couch. She pulls the blanket from her
legs - adjusting on the small couch.

43.
51 CONTINUED: (3) 51

Silence.
Jay stands up and walks slowly towards the edge of the room.
She rounds the corner - stepping closer and closer to the
kitchen.
52 INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 52
Jay hesitantly peeks inside the kitchen doorway.
A HALF-NAKED YOUNG WOMAN, with a slight resemblance to Jay,
walks very slowly towards her. Small steps.
She's missing her two front teeth, while urinating through her
brown suede skirt.
Dark circles around her eyes. A tube sock on one foot. The
other bare. Immodest and vulgar.
Jay chokes on a scream and backs away.
She knocks over some household nick-knacks as she crosses the
dining room.
Rushing towards the stairwell - Jay runs up to the home's
second floor. A mad dash.
53 INT. JAY'S UPSTAIRS - CONTINUOUS 53
Jay reaches the top landing and races towards the large rec
room. Inside, she slams the door shut, locks it and backs up
towards the far wall.
She breathes and listens.
Footsteps.
A knock on the door.

KELLY
(behind door)
Jay?

Jay doesn't say a word. She sits still. Waiting.

PAUL
(behind door)
Jay, can you open the door?

Jay shakes her head.

KELLY
(behind door)
What's going on?

44.
51 CONTINUED: (4) 51

(CONTINUED)

JAY
It's in the house.
PAUL
(behind door)
There's nothing in the house, Jay.

JAY
I saw it.
KELLY
(behind door)
Just open the door, OK?

Jay watches as the door-knob rattles - then stops.

JAY
It's in the kitchen.
PAUL
(behind door)
I'm not gonna let anything happen to
you. Open the door and we'll figure
it out.
Jay doesn't move.

PAUL
(behind door)
There's nothing here.

Jay gets up and slowly walks to the door. She reaches for the
handle and turns it.
Peeking out, she sees Paul and Kelly standing alone.

JAY
Get in here.

Jay waves them into the room. Once inside, she closes and re-
locks the door.

Kelly stands with arms crossed, while Paul sits on the edge of
a chair.

KELLY

Jay, why don't you sit down?

Jay paces and looks from the door to the second-story window.
She crumbles down onto the floor.
Kelly and Paul are silent.

45.
53 CONTINUED: 53

(CONTINUED)

JAY

I need water. Oh my god I need some
water.

KELLY
I'll get you some.
JAY
No. Stay here.
Jay shivers and holds herself.
JAY

Is something wrong with me?

PAUL

Somebody broke the window. That
really happened.
JAY

Yeah, but I saw a girl in the kitchen.

Jay pushes herself against the wall - almost in shock. Kelly
comes over and rubs her shoulder.
KELLY

I love you. You're ok. It's gonna be
alright.
JAY

You don't believe me.
KELLY

Not all of it... no. But some of it.

There's a tapping sound at the door. All three kids turn and
stare. The doorknob shakes a bit. Almost turns - but stops.

KELLY

Mom?

Knock. Knock. Knock. Three soft taps on the door.
Jay crawls across the floor towards the window, shushing her
sister with a panicked gesture.
Worried, Paul picks up a broom from the corner of the room and
stands near the door - wooden stick raised.

KELLY
Mom, is that you?

Jay shakes her head.

46.
53 CONTINUED: (2) 53

(CONTINUED)

YARA
(behind door)
No. It's me.
KELLY

Yara?

YARA

Yup.

Kelly stands and approaches the door. She unlocks it, grabs
the doorknob and turns...
JAY
Don't open the door.
Kelly opens the door revealing...
Yara, sleepy-eyed and bored, stands in the doorway, holding
her glasses. She rubs the sleep from her eyes, while chewing
on a red vine dangling from her mouth.

KELLY
See? Everything's ok.

Suddenly -
A VERY LARGE MAN peeks out from behind Yara's shoulder -
bending his head down into the door frame like some kind of
giant. He stares at Jay.
Jay screams as the large man follows Yara into the room -
remaining just inches behind the petite young woman.

Paul looks at Jay - confused. No one but Jay sees the long-
limbed giant moving closer.

Jay rushes to the back window, opens it, pushes out the screen
and crawls through.
Kelly, Paul and Yara run towards her, trying to hold her arms.

KELLY
Jay, be careful!
PAUL
Hey, wait!

54 EXT. JAY'S ROOF - CONTINUOUS 54
Jay pulls her arm away and steps onto the edge of the roof.
She stands, looking down.

47.
53 CONTINUED: (3) 53

(CONTINUED)

The large man walks very slowly towards her, visible through
the frame of the window - over Paul, Yara and Kelly's
shoulders.
Jay turns and steps along the edge of the roof towards the
side of the house.
Kelly looks out the window as Jay moves from view.

KELLY

Jay! What are you doing?!

PAUL
(to Kelly)
I'll get her.

Paul runs into the hallway - disappearing down the stairwell.
Jay lowers herself to the fence and hops into the alleyway.
A boy's bicycle leans against the neighbor's house. Jay grabs
it, jumps on and rides off into the street.
55 INT. GREG'S GARAGE - CONTINUOUS 55
Greg sits with a pretty girl in his open garage, smoking a
joint. They're flirting - his hand on her leg.
Greg notices Jay pedaling the kid's bike into the street. He
watches, puzzled, as she rides off. Paul emerges from the
front door.
56 EXT. PARK - NIGHT 56
Jay rides the bike into the middle of the park. She stops in
an open area near the swings and an old spider-web jungle gym.
Rusted cartoon faces hover over the play area on the tops of
the gym's posts.
The chains of the swings rattle in the wind.
Jay steps off the bike and lays it down on the sandy ground.
She looks around at the open park. Large elm trees and dirt
paths spread out around the grassy patches of the block.
Jay watches for movement. It's quiet and still.
She walks across the lot towards the swings and sits down -
nearly in shock - trying to calm herself - looking for
something grounded and real.
She starts to swing - very lightly. A young woman in pajamas -
alone in the night.

48.
54 CONTINUED: 54

(CONTINUED)

Her feet slide across the sand and she holds them higher.
Jay watches the park. Swinging.
Forward. Back. A dog barks in the distance. Crickets chirp.
The dog stops barking. It's quiet again.
The swing creaks quietly - the sound echoes across the trees.
Jay sees a figure approaching through the trees - partially
hidden by the darkness.
She stops the swing and watches - afraid - ready to run.

PAUL

Jay!

Kelly, Paul and Yara emerge from the darkness of the park.
Meeting in the open lot, Kelly runs up to Jay.

KELLY

You could've hurt yourself! What are
you doing?

The sisters hug. Amid their embrace, they whisper...

JAY
(whispers)
I'm really scared, Kel.

KELLY
(whispers)
Me too, but we'll figure it out.

JAY
(whispers)
You can't tell mom. She'll freak out
and she won't believe me.

KELLY
(whispers)
I know. It's ok.
YARA

What were you running away from?

Jay sees something. A silhouette moves through the street. All
eyes turn towards the approaching shape.

JAY
Do you see that?

49.
56 CONTINUED: 56

(CONTINUED)

KELLY

I do.

YARA
It's... a person.

Stepping into the light from nearby street lamps - Greg
emerges from the darkness.
JAY

Greg?

GREG

What the hell's going on?
Jay struggles to find a response.
GREG
Are you ok?

Jay nods. Paul glares at Greg - unnoticed.

PAUL

Somebody broke into their house.

GREG

Shit. Did you call the police?

Jay shakes her head no.
JAY

I don't want to go home.

GREG

Where do you wanna go?
Jay exhales - looking up at Kelly.

JAY
I need to find him.
GREG

The person who broke into your house?

JAY

No.

KELLY

Hugh?

Jay nods. It's a small and meek response from a normally
strong young woman.
GREG

What did he really do to you?

50.
56 CONTINUED: (2) 56

(CONTINUED)

Jay shakes her head and shrugs, looking down at the ground -
rubbing her eyes with her hand.
Kelly offers Greg a look - let Jay be.

GREG
(quiet)
Ok.

The gang stands around in silence - amidst the quiet park.
Greg turns and starts to walk away. Jay notices him walking
off.

JAY
Are you leaving?
GREG

No, I'm getting my car. Somebody's
gotta drive, right?

Greg jogs off. Kelly and Jay sit down on the edge of the
merry-go-round looking out at the shadowy park. The sky has
nearly achieved its pre-dawn blue.
57 INT. GREG'S CAR - DAWN 57
Jay sits in the passenger seat while Greg drives. Paul, Yara
and Kelly sit in the back. Yara snacks on a large donut, while
reading from her phone. Chocolate on her fingers.
The car drives into the inner city. The neighborhoods become
poorer - more decayed and urban.
Jay sees a pair of middle-aged women walking carts down the
street. A third and older woman trails behind them. Jay
notices her watching their car as they pass. The sound of
Greg's engine grows louder - feeding back on itself
unnaturally.
Further on, Jay sees a homeless man standing behind a
telephone pole on the side of the road. The man is perfectly
divided by, and almost hiding behind the pole.
They pass him and continue on.
58 EXT. HUGH'S DETROIT HOME - DAWN 58
Greg's car pulls up and stops in front of an old inner-city
house. It sits alongside an overgrown field with a distant
view of the towering Renaissance Center.
Early morning fog drifts across the face of the brick
building.

51.
56 CONTINUED: (3) 56

(CONTINUED)

A patch of police tape is strung across the front door. A sign
on the lawn reads: FOR RENT.
59 EXT. BACKYARD OF HUGH'S DETROIT HOME - DAWN 59
Paul stands on the gas meter pulling a window open. Jay, Greg,
Kelly and Yara stand along the back wall of the house, looking
around at the weed-filled lawn and adjoining backyards.
As Paul crawls inside, we hear the jingle of clinking cans and
a bell rattle.
A dog begins to bark loudly from a distant yard.
Jay notices an old woman peeking out from behind a neighboring
house. The woman stares suspiciously, then disappears.
Paul opens the back door, gesturing for the gang to enter.
60 INT. LIVING/DINING ROOM OF HUGH'S DETROIT HOME - DAWN 60
The camera pushes forward through a dark hall.
Tiny beams of morning light shine through the covered windows.
Large swathes of shadow obscure the details of the dim space.
A dusty mist fills the air.
Piles of debris rest on the coffee table. Couch cushions are
flipped. The television is face down on the floor.
Jay and Greg walk cautiously into the dark living room.
Moving to the curtain-covered bay window, Jay stares at an odd
collection of cans, bottles and bells that hang from string
across the entire length. She runs her hand over the
primitive alarm.
Clink Clink jingle jingle.
Greg discovers a similar string of cans and bells across the
smaller side window.
61 INT. BATHROOM OF HUGH'S DETROIT HOME - DAWN 61
Kelly rifles through drawers and checks the medicine cabinet.
She finds several bottles of pills. The labels have been torn
off.
Bits of daylight shine through a tiny window above the shower.
Kelly sees a bloody razor blade on the floor near a stack of
towels.

52.
58 CONTINUED: 58

62 INT. KITCHEN OF HUGH'S DETROIT HOME - DAWN 62
Yara opens the fridge and makes a funny face at the sight of
open leftovers and rotten fruit.
YARA

I don't think he spent a lot of time
here.

63 INT. BATHROOM OF HUGH'S DETROIT HOME - DAWN 63
Kelly notices a crack in the wall of the bathroom. She runs
her hand along the split in the dry-wall. Kelly applies some
pressure and a large piece of wall falls away - revealing a
hole leading to the adjoining room.
Jay peeks through the hole to her sister.

JAY

He told me never to go into a room
that didn't have more than one way
out.

Kelly shakes her head - surprised by the oddness of the
situation.
64 INT. BEDROOM OF HUGH'S DETROIT HOME - DAWN 64
Paul enters the upstairs bedroom. Water-stains line the wall.
An old mattress sits on the floor. Debris and clothes boxes
fill the space.
Paul digs carefully through the cardboard boxes - sorting
through a few remaining articles of clothes. A couple pairs of
socks. Some underwear.
65 INT. KITCHEN OF HUGH'S DETROIT HOME - DAWN 65
Standing on the counter, Yara digs through the upper cabinets,
using her cell phone to illuminate the junk inside. Greg stops
nearby, looking up at her legs. Admiring.
Yara peeks into the cabinet. Pushing aside a dusty row of
mugs...
A cockroach runs out and scampers across her hand.

YARA
Ehhh!! Fuck!

Yara shakes her hand in disgust. Greg chuckles.

53.

66 INT. BASEMENT OF HUGH'S DETROIT HOME - DAWN 66
Kelly walks alone through the garbage filled cellar. The
camera pushes slowly through the dusty shadows toward a ground
level window. There's tension as we near the sun-misted glass.
Nothing passes.
67 INT. BEDROOM OF HUGH'S DETROIT HOME - DAWN 67
Under some crumpled and stained tissue paper, Paul discovers a
small stack of porn magazines.
He lifts them and sits on the edge of the bed, sifting through
the various covers.
He selects one and casually flips through the magazine -
perusing a nude woman's pictorial.
Jay enters the bedroom and sees him. She shakes her head and
moves to the bedroom's far window. It's taped over with
newspapers and comic book pages. A few tears allow some
morning light into Hugh's grim-looking sleep quarters.
Jay peeks through a hole in the comic book page, looking down
at the nearby field. She sees a homeless man walking through
the tall grass. He disappears behind a tree. Jay backs away
quickly, bumping the string of cans with her arm.
Paul turns another page and finds a loose photo wedged inside.
He pulls the picture out and examines it.

PAUL
Hey, look at this.
JAY

What?

PAUL
Is this him?

Jay moves to the bed and looks down at the photo in Paul's
hand. She sees a younger, teenage-version of Hugh with some
old girlfriend. They both have bad haircuts. The girl, a
cheerleader, is wearing a boy's oversized high school
letterman jacket. It reads: Lawson Vikings.

PAUL

Do you recognize the letterman jacket?

JAY
Lawson High School.

Paul nods in agreement.

54.

(CONTINUED)

PAUL

Somebody's gonna know his real name.

Jay looks closely at Hugh's smiling face.
68 INT. LAWSON HIGH SCHOOL HALL - DAY 68
Down a long, locker-filled hallway, Greg and Jay walk together
towards the main office.
A few kids pass them, walking to class - dodging work.
69 INT. LAWSON HIGH SCHOOL HALL - DAY 69
Through a medium-sized window in the hall, we see a couple
high school kids making out behind a tree - only pieces of the
action from a distance. A teen boy in ugly clothes walks by
eating an apple.
The camera pans, crossing the hall and focusing on the nearby
main office.
70 INT. LAWSON HIGH SCHOOL OFFICE - DAY 70
Through the glass we watch as Jay and Greg speak with a couple
of school employees. The photo sits on the counter between
them.
One woman grabs a large book from a shelf, opens it and flips
through pages as a man types slowly on his old computer. Greg
watches.
Jay stops and turns, looking out past us and the camera,
scanning the area - she is constantly on guard.
Jay turns back and listens as the woman talks.
The camera pans again, back towards the window.
Outside, the couple are still kissing behind the tree.
A YOUNG WOMAN WITH RED HAIR is walking towards the building,
carrying a backpack.
A few teen girlfriends cross the window, laughing and
chatting.
71 INT. GREG'S CAR - DAY 71
Paul and Kelly sit in the back seat of the car like kids
waiting for their parents. Yara sleeps on Kelly's shoulder.
Greg and Jay open their doors and hop into the front.
The high school building is visible through the front window.
55.
67 CONTINUED: 67

(CONTINUED)

PAUL
Did they know?
GREG

Yup.

JAY

His real name's Jeff.

In the distance, the young redhead with a backpack is visible
walking towards the car. She's quite far away. No one sees
her.

PAUL
Not Hugh?
GREG
(shaking his head)
Jeff Redmond.
KELLY
Do we tell the police?

Greg starts the car. The radio comes on - quiet. A seat-belt
alarm dings repeatedly. Greg buckles up - Jay doesn't.

JAY

No.

The redhead walks closer as Greg backs the car up and pulls
out of the school lot. No one sees her, except us (and
probably only some of us).
Paul sees Jay and Greg share a moment of eye contact. Greg
rubs Jay's shoulder for comfort.
Paul makes a face - slightly irritated.
72 EXT. HILLY SUBURBAN ROAD - DAY 72
Greg's car pulls up in front of a large upper-middle-class
house on the more rural edge of the county. Well manicured
lawns enhance the neighborhood's stature.
Jay climbs out of the car and walks up to the front door. Her
friends pile out of the car and stand around it, like a ragged
gang from a B-picture version of "West Side Story".
Jay rings the bell and waits. She looks down the street -
watching the empty road.

The door opens and a friendly middle-aged woman in a rumpled t-
shirt and "mom jeans" greets Jay. MRS. REDMOND smiles and

looks to her.

56.
71 CONTINUED: 71

(CONTINUED)

MRS. REDMOND

Hello.

Jay stares at the woman - taken aback. Mrs. Redmond is a dead-
ringer for the naked woman seen earlier at the abandoned

warehouse.

JAY

Hi. Um. Is Jeff here?
MRS. REDMOND

Yeah. He is. Um... Do you wanna come
in?

JAY

Yeah.

Mrs. Redmond glances back at Jay's friends by the car.

MRS. REDMOND

Your friends?
JAY
That'd be great.

Jay waves her sister and friends over.
73 INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY 73
Mrs. Redmond leads Jay and her friends down a long hallway to
the back of the house.
They reach a doorway. Mrs. Redmond knocks.

MRS. REDMOND

Hey Jeff, you got friends here.

Silence.

MRS. REDMOND

Jeff.

JEFF

Yeah mom. I'm coming.

The door unlocks and opens. Jeff looks out past his mom to
Jay and her gang. His face reveals the awkwardness and stress
of the moment. He tries to hide it from his mother.

JEFF

Hey.

Jay looks back at him - waiting for something.

57.
72 CONTINUED: 72

(CONTINUED)

JAY

Hey.

MRS. REDMOND

Well I'll leave you kids alone.

Mrs. Redmond walks back down the hall. Jeff looks at Jay.
She stares him down.
No one notices, but on Jeff's left wrist, the edge of a
bandage peeks out from under his long sleeve shirt.

JEFF
You wanna come in?

Jay shrugs and steps into Jeff's bedroom. Paul, Kelly, Yara
and Greg follow. Jeff appears uneasy.
Jay looks around the room. It's a very typical boy's bedroom -
probably too immature for Jeff.
Tired, Yara lays across the bed and watches the scene unfold.
Greg closes the door, blocking Jeff in. He hovers near the
young man as though he's about to punch him.
Seeing that he's trapped, Jeff looks over at Jay.

JEFF
I'm sorry.

Jay ignores him - looking at a small, candid photograph on
Jeff's dresser.
In the photo-booth strip: Jeff smiles alongside a laughing and
happy young woman: Annie.
JEFF

You don't know how horrible I feel.

Greg smacks Jeff in the face.
GREG
Fuck you.

Jeff does nothing in return. He has tears in his eyes.

JEFF

Are you gonna call the police?

JAY
I'm not sure yet.

58.
73 CONTINUED: 73

(CONTINUED)

JEFF
(his voice is weepy and
weak)
Please don't tell my family. Ok?

JAY

I just want to know what's going on.

JEFF

Ok, but can we talk outside? It's not
safe in here. It's really not safe.

74 EXT. JEFF'S BACKYARD - DAY 74
Jeff sits before an open expanse of lawns and landscaped
backyards. There are no fences here.
On the grass at the edge of the patio, Jay and her friends sit
around the host - like a teenage mob. They're drinking soda
pop from straws.
Mrs. Redmond steps outside - smiling. She sets out a tray of
baked snacks for the group.

MRS. REDMOND

Ok. I hope you like puffed crispy
treats.

PAUL
Thank you.

Yara grabs a crispy treat and begins to eat.

MRS. REDMOND
Of course. You're welcome.

The kids nod awkwardly as they sip their cola beverages. The
mother smiles and walks inside, carefully sliding the glass
door closed.
Once gone, all expressions change. Jeff maintains a low
whisper, trying to conceal the situation from his mother. His
eyes are red from crying.
JEFF
(looking at Jay)
Even though it's following you, I can
still see it... it's not done with me
either. It just wants you first. Like
I told you, all you can do pass it to
someone else.

Jay picks at the ground, pulling up a blade of grass and
tearing it into smaller strips, placing them on her leg.
59.
73 CONTINUED: (2) 73

(CONTINUED)

KELLY

What the fuck are you talking about?

Further down the block, a TEENAGE GIRL IN A SOCCER JERSEY
appears, cutting across the neighbor's back lawns on her way
home. For now, she appears as a dot on the horizon - too
distant to be seen by anyone.
JEFF

She can do the same thing I did. It
should be easier for her. She's a
girl.

Jeff turns and looks straight at Jay.

JEFF

Any guy would be with you. Just sleep
with somebody and tell them to do the
same. Maybe it'll never come back.

Paul stares longingly at Jay from behind his can of soda. We
see the figure of the soccer girl begin to take shape in the
distance. A casual stroll - a backpack slung over shoulder.

PAUL

Is that really possible?

GREG

Bullshit. Total fucking bullshit.

Jay pulls apart the blades of grass within her palm - fixating
on the tiny details of the plant.
KELLY
(looking at Jeff)
You should take it back.
Jeff looks at Kelly - making a face.

KELLY
(to Jeff)
You know what I mean.
JEFF

It doesn't work that way.

JAY
(almost to herself)
I would never sleep with him again.

Greg exhales - growing frustrated with the nature of the
conversation.

60.
74 CONTINUED: 74

(CONTINUED)

GREG

This isn't real. I promise you the
whole thing is some fucked up game.

Jeff looks at Jay - her melancholy profile - down-turned. Over
her shoulder, he finally notices the teenage soccer girl
walking in his direction - still far away. The camera zooms in
on the girl. Jeff is clearly distracted and frightened.

JEFF

I'm not safe either. OK? We shouldn't
be in the same place. You need to get
the fuck out of here.
GREG
Watch it.

Jeff glances back to the soccer girl. She strolls lazily
across the lawns. A bit closer.
JEFF
(getting nervous)
If it kills you, it comes back to me
and then all the way down the line to
whoever the hell started it.

Jay stares down at her hand - losing herself in the slight
movement of her flesh and fingers - something grounded and
real. Paul watches her with sadness and longing.

JEFF
(nervous and quick)
Jay, I'm sorry. I wasn't trying to
hurt you. Somebody did this to me too,
ya know.

Greg is sweating now. He steals another look at the soccer
girl. She looks back at him - then looks down.

KELLY
Who did it to you?
JEFF
(nervous)
I met a girl at a bar... it was a one
night stand... I don't even know her
name. I think that's where it came
from.

Greg rolls his eyes in frustration.

GREG

Jeff? I don't believe you...

61.
74 CONTINUED: (2) 74

(CONTINUED)

Jeff focuses completely on the approaching girl. He's
fidgeting - ready to stand and run.

GREG

She might, but I think you're a liar.
This is some fucked up shit you're -
(doing to her).

Jeff interrupts -

JEFF

Do you guys see that girl right
there?!?

Jeff points and stares in the direction of the passing soccer
girl. Everyone turns around and looks at the shy teenager,
bobbing her head to the music. She notices and makes a worried
face, shifting her path away from Jeff and the group.
KELLY, PAUL, JAY GREG YARA
(simultaneous) (nodding)
Yes.... Yeah... Uh huh...
Jeff regains his composure. He tries to adjust.

JEFF

Ok. Good. Um... listen... Jay...

Jeff faces Jay directly.
JEFF

Wherever you are, it’s somewhere
walking straight for you... but it is
walking. If you drive far enough, you
can buy yourself some time to think...
decide if you wanna give it to someone
else.

Jay glances down at the ground, as Greg and Paul sit silently.
Paul steals a look toward Jay.

Paul, Kelly and Jay are crammed in the back, along with their
luggage.

KELLY
(to Greg)
Um... Greg?
GREG

Yeah?

KELLY

Your mom’s not gonna freak out?

GREG
She won’t even know.
KELLY

It’s really nice of you.

GREG

I love coming up here. My dad used to
take me hunting a couple times a year.
It’s not like super nice, but it’s
cool.

Kelly nods and smiles, leaning closer to Jay.

KELLY
(whispering)
Have you thought about what he said?

Jay takes a pill from her purse.
JAY
(whispering)
What?

KELLY
(whispering)
Maybe passing it on?

Jay shakes her head as she swallows the pill with some water.

JAY
(whispering)
I don’t know.

Kelly shrugs a bit. Paul peeks at Jay out of the corner of his
eye - under the cover of sleep.
Highway signs pass by.
Miles of road.

78 CONTINUED: 78

79 EXT. HIGHWAY - MORNING 79

83 EXT. GREG'S LAKE HOUSE - MORNING 83
Greg's car arrives in front of a lake house surrounded by open
fields.
Beyond the house is a medium-sized lake.
The gang start to climb out, stretching in the morning sun.
Greg unlocks the door and steps inside.
84 INT. LAKE HOUSE LIVING ROOM - MORNING 84
Jay and Paul string bells and bottles over the windows and
doors. Sitting on the floor - threading old soup cans with
string, Jay speaks into an old 70’s-style phone receiver.

JAY
(into phone)
Hello, yes, um, this is Mrs. Height.
I’m calling to let you know that my
daughter Kelly is sick with the flu
and she’s gonna be out for a few days -
uh maybe longer.
(beat)
Uh huh. Yeah. I know. It’s the season
change I guess.
(beat)
Ok well, thank you. Bye.

Kelly fries bacon at the stove, while making pancakes for the
group. She watches her sister from across the room.
A radio on the counter plays an old AM rock tune.
Yara dances by herself to the music, snacking on bacon as she
reads her ebook. Swaying and stepping - her moves are
intentionally silly.
Greg drinks a beer on the couch, staring at Yara's ass
whenever possible.

64.

(CONTINUED)

Family photos of Greg and his parents line the walls. Old
remnants of joyful times litter the room.
Hanging up the phone, Jay stands at the edge of the kitchen,
looking out the window. She watches the empty field, driveway
and lake.
Birds chirp happily in the distance.
85 EXT. OLD SHED - MORNING 85
Greg unlocks the door to a shed behind the house. He pulls a
metal case from the dusty shelf.
Inside, he finds a small HANDGUN and some bullets.
Greg closes the case, and tucks it under his arm.
86 EXT. FIELD - DAY 86
Greg stands next to Jay as she fires the handgun at a far-off
row of canned goods and mini cereal boxes.
He helps to adjust her aim.
Kelly and Paul watch from the distant grass - as shots ring
out and echo. Yara reads from her phone.
Paul seems irritated.
GREG

It sucks sticking around after
everyone's gone, huh?

JAY
It's a bit lonely.
GREG

I'm right across the street you know.

JAY
I remember.

BANG! A full size box of Fruity Fun Cereal is hit, causing a
trickle of colorful rice to pour from the bullet hole.
87 EXT. BOAT & LAKE - DAY 87
The boat is anchored in the center of the lake. The water is
calm.
The breeze passes like a whisper across Jay's bangs. She
turns onto her back and lays out across the front of the boat -
feeling the warm sun.

65.
84 CONTINUED: 84

(CONTINUED)

Greg dives into the water, while Paul cannonballs in.
Kelly sits near her sister, while Yara dips a toe in the lake
from the safety of the rear ladder - sipping a beer and eating
snack chips.

JAY

I feel safe out here.
KELLY

We'll stay as long as we can. Mom
doesn't care.
JAY

I wonder how long it'll take before it
gets here.
KELLY

Jay, there's nothing coming, ok?

Jay looks back towards the shore and watches the tree-line and
the open field. She stares deeply at the land. Nothing
moves.
88 EXT. BOAT & LAKE - DAY 88
Yara dives underwater, kicking her feet above the surface.
Loud splashes.
Kelly holds on to the anchor-rope, floating calmly on her
back.
We notice Greg glancing over at Kelly, treading water with
beer in hand.
Jay swims alone.
Drying his face with a towel, Paul watches her from the boat.
89 EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY 89
We slowly push forward - moving up along the expressway. Cars
race towards us - passing on either side. We creep along,
unfazed by their proximity.
Closer and closer.
90 OMITTED 90
91 OMITTED 91
92 EXT. WOODS - NIGHT 92
The trees pass as we move very slowly but steadily through the
forest.

66.
87 CONTINUED: 87

(CONTINUED)

The wind howls.
A bird flutters past us.
Distant lightning illuminates the woods. Thunder rumbles.
We move closer...
93 INT. LAKE HOUSE - NIGHT 93
A bell rings. Jay turns and sees Paul step through her
doorway. He closes the door with a final rattle and ring.
Jay stares up at him from her bed. Rain pours against the
window.

JAY

Hey.

PAUL
Hi. How are you?
JAY
Um... I don't know.
PAUL

Yeah.

Paul sits down on the side of her bed. He looks over and eyes
her. She glances back.
There's a silence in the room. Jay shifts under her covers.
Paul reaches over and holds Jay's hand. They sit in silence.
Jay stares down at their hands - intertwined. She appears a
bit uneasy.
Paul leans down and tries to kiss Jay. She pulls her head
away.

JAY
No, Paul.
PAUL

What?

Jay doesn't know what to say.
PAUL

I know you feel kind of alone and I
just wanted to tell you that... I'm
here for you.
JAY
I know.

67.
92 CONTINUED: 92

(CONTINUED)

Paul takes a breath. It's getting awkward.

PAUL

No, I mean... I'm here for you.

Paul places his hand on Jay's leg. Finally understanding what
he's saying, she politely moves his hand away.

JAY

Oh... um... Paul, I...

Paul swallows hard as Kelly knocks on the door. The bell
rings as she walks into the room.
She's in a towel. Seeing Paul, she rolls her eyes and gives
him a shake of her head.
KELLY

Out.

Jay smirks as Paul leaves the bedroom.
94 EXT. LAKE HOUSE - NIGHT 94
Rain pours from the gutters on the ground.
Drops ping off the side of the awning.
The lake dances with volatile drops of water.
Rain falls across the windows of the lake house.
95 EXT. FIELD - MORNING 95
A grey mist has settled over the area.
Jay relaxes on one of the lawn chairs in the center of the
field - near the lake. A breeze tussles her hair. She appears
calm, but sad.
Kelly, Greg and Paul lounge around her - some on the wet grass
- others in chairs.
Paul stares lovingly at Jay. She watches the horizon.
Behind Jay - over her shoulder - we watch as Yara steps from
the forest into view - far off - by the dirt road.
Yara walks closer. Paul looks off - into her direction.
Greg notices Kelly's leg - stretched across the grass. She
sees him checking her out. His warm eyes cause her to look
away - more from shyness than anything else.

68.
93 CONTINUED: 93

(CONTINUED)

Greg gulps and finishes his beer as he stands - dropping the
can into the grass. He walks off - trudging towards the
distant trees.
Paul looks up at the sky - raising his hand up to feel the
sun. Behind him, we see Yara in her bathing suit floating
across the shallow edge of the lake on a circular inner-tube.
She floats lazily by - a small but visible shape in the
background.
There are clearly two Yaras. One is in the water. One is
approaching behind Jay.
Paul looks back to Jay. She turns to her side and looks back
towards the lake house. Behind her, Yara is now much closer -
continuing to approach.
YARA

You should get in the water!

From her inner-tube, Yara looks back to her friends. Kelly
glances over to her sister. Jay yawns and stretches.

KELLY
You want to?
JAY
No. You go ahead.

We see Greg - very far away - step into the trees, drop his
shorts and start to pee.
KELLY

Come on.
JAY

Eh.

KELLY
Get up. It'll be nice.

Kelly starts to get up. We see the group, lounging together in
the field.

JAY

Maybe in a little bit.
KELLY
Don’t be so lazy.

As Jay sits in her chair, her long hair rises into the air -
without cause or explanation - like a Michaël Borremans’
painting.

69.
95 CONTINUED: 95

(CONTINUED)

Kelly and Paul see this occur. Jay immediately realizes
something is behind her. She jumps from her chair, screams and
steps backwards. The chair topples. An invisible force pulls
her head down and prevents her from moving more than a few
feet. She pulls backwards - a tug of war - her hair is the
rope.

JAY
Help me!

Kelly takes a step closer - tentative with confusion.

KELLY
Jay?! What is it?!

Paul jumps up and grabs the fallen chair. He swings it down
into the air.
We watch as the chair smashes into an invisible object -
cracking - hurting Paul's hand.
Jay’s hair is released - dropping back to her shoulders. She
tumbles away, tripping over a cooler and falling to the
ground. Kelly rushes to help her.
Paul steps closer - suddenly he’s pushed violently across the
grass - landing on his shoulder.
Jay crawls and stumbles away from the advancing thing. The
fake Yara follows her - bloodied but unfazed.
In the distance, Greg quickly pulls up his shorts and starts
to walk back - a cautious, hyper-aware gait.

GREG

Will you guys tell me what's goin'
on?!

The real Yara rushes through the shallow water and helps Jay
up. She pulls her towards the lake house as Paul manages to
stand, backing away from the center of the field - terrified
and unsure how to help.
Kelly runs after her sister. Jay keeps moving - glancing back
and pointing.
Yara, or something that looks like her, follows. The gap
widens, but the thing keeps coming. Slowly of course.
Jay's friends and sister pass right by the thing as they rush
to her aid. They see nothing.

70.
95 CONTINUED: (2) 95

95A EXT. EDGE OF FIELD - CONTINUOUS 95A
Greg is still far off - approaching along the edge of the
clearing. We track behind him as he watches the odd sight:
Jay is backing away - screaming, pointing and staring at
nothingness.

96 INT. LAKE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 96
Jay picks up the hand gun and runs to the door.

KELLY
What're you doing?!

Jay raises the gun up. She aims at the thing. Yara stares
back at her. Mouth open.
Paul is almost hyper-ventilating at the edge of the room. He
sees nothing but a frightened and hurt young woman aiming a
gun into the air. He hides behind the couch.
Jay waits until it gets near. She aims at its face - Jay
pulls the trigger.
Bang!!!
Greg dives down - taking cover in the grass.

PAUL

Fuck!

The bullet slices through Yara’s forehead and ricochets out
her temple. Blood pours from her skull as she slumps to the
ground.

GREG
(in distance)
Stop shooting!!

Greg jumps up, arms in the air. He starts to come closer.

KELLY
Jay, please!!

The bloody Yara rises and continues walking towards Jay as
though nothing happened.

71.

96A EXT. FIELD - CONTINUOUS 96A
As Greg moves toward Jay with his arms in the air, she raises
her pistol once again. She fires several times - the bullets
coming right at us. Greg dives for cover.
Jay steps back and pulls the front door closed.
96B INT. LAKE HOUSE LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 96B
Jay locks the front door and slumps onto the ground. She
starts to cry. Kelly tries to hold her but she can't be
consoled.
Paul lifts his shirt and sees a swollen red welt across his
abdomen.
Jay peeks up toward the front window. She sees a large man
looking in through the glass. He shuffles slowly to the side -
out of sight.
Smash!!!
There's a loud pounding from the front door. The wood shakes.
It hits again. The banging gets louder.
A foot breaks through the bottom of the door.
The women scream. Paul jumps in fear.
Yara watches as wood splinters from the center - seemingly
without cause.
Jay watches as the foot kicks out a medium chunk of paneling
from the bottom of the door. The foot retracts and
disappears.
Silence - except for the soft crying within the room.
The friends and siblings look to the door - waiting.
Slowly... we push in... closer on the hole...
Greg appears, looking in through the broken door - his head
tilted at an angle.

GREG

What the hell are you guys doing?!
JAY
Greg, it's outside!

YARA
Don’t open the door!

72.

(CONTINUED)

GREG

What did you do to the door?!
JAY
It's trying to get in!

PAUL
We didn’t do it!

GREG

There's nothing out here!

JAY
Yes there is!

Greg pounds his fist into the door. He pulls away and
disappears from view.
GREG

(O.S.)
What the fuck... son-of-a...

KELLY

Greg, did you kick the door?
Was it you?

Silence.
We hear only Jay, Kelly, Yara and Paul, breathing deeply.
Frightened and labored breaths.
Outside... it's quiet.
JAY

Greg?
He doesn't respond.

JAY
Greg, are you ok?

Jay leans closer to the door, peeking into the hole.
Suddenly...
A very LITTLE BOY WITH A STRANGE FACE pokes his head into the
opening. Jay screams and jumps as the little kid crawls
through the hole in the door.
KELLY
Jay, what do you see?!

The innocent looking boy stares at Jay and screams loudly -
like an elderly woman.
Jay flinches and covers her ears. She pulls herself up and
scrambles away, grabbing the car keys from the table.
There's a pounding from the other side of the house.
Jay runs toward the rear door.

73.
96B CONTINUED: 96B

(CONTINUED)

Now inside, the little boy steps across the room.
Paul follows Jay as she unlocks the back door, revealing Greg -
pounding on it.

GREG
What is going on?!!
Jay pushes past him, moving outside.

PAUL
I don't know!

Greg stares into the lake house with anger and confusion - we
don't see anything other than hysterical teenagers.

GREG
(muttering to himself)
What the fuck...

Yara is crying on the floor, while Kelly stands shaking - in
shock. Greg marches past them.
97 EXT. LAKE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 97
Jay runs to the car, fumbling with the key fob, unlocking the
door.
As Jay climbs into the driver's seat, Greg emerges from the
front door of the lake house. He inspects the crack in the
door.
98 INT. GREG'S CAR - CONTINUOUS 98
Starting the car, Jay sees a young woman, Annie, walk past
Greg and the others - staring at her from a distance.
Greg is shouting - trying to calm everyone down.
Jay continues to cry - not loudly - just streams of
involuntary tears. She throws the car into gear.
Kelly runs from the side of the house, spotting her sister in
the car.

KELLY
(distant)
Jay! Wait!

We back up at a mad speed, turning and racing up the dirt road
towards the highway.
The engine roars - and whines.
Kelly, Yara, Paul and Greg watch as Jay drives off.

74.
96B CONTINUED: (2) 96B

(CONTINUED)

GREG

Where are you going?! That's my
fucking car!!

The house, the friends and Annie recede into the background.
Jay stares ahead in shock. Her hands are shaking on the
steering wheel.
The teenage girl presses down on the gas. She steers wide -
turning a corner in the road.
Jay looks back over her shoulder. Panicked.
Up ahead, a pickup truck begins to pull out from the
intersection. Protected by a stop sign - nothing more.
Jay is going too fast. Unable to stop. The truck tries to
swerve.
She pulls at the wheel, hitting the brake and cutting left.
Losing control.
She crashes hard into a bank of trees.
99 INT. HOSPITAL - DAY 99
Jay opens her eyes. Her head is slightly bandaged around her
forehead. A small circle of dried blood rests on the cotton
wrap - an IV in her left arm.
Her right arm is covered in a cast - extending from her
fingers to her bicep.
Jay sees the foot of her hospital bed. A monitor and the open
doorway leading to a hallway.
She stares into the hall. An empty waiting room is visible
beyond another door.
A NOSY WOMAN passes by - peeking over at Jay.
An unseen MAN screams in pain from a distant room.

OLD MAN
(O.S.)
Somebody come and help me! I need some
helppp! Somebody please! I just need
some helppp!!

Jay watches the door - she begins to frighten herself. Her
breathing grows shallow.
She looks down and presses the call button. It rings, but no
one responds.

75.
98 CONTINUED: 98

(CONTINUED)

The hallway appears empty. The man's cries are silenced. The
call button beeps intermittently.
JAY

Hello?

Jay stares into the doorway.
JAY
Helloooo?

The camera moves closer and closer to the open space.
Kelly steps into frame, walking from the waiting room around
the corner. She crosses the hall - an expression of sadness on
her face.
Jay sees her coming. She stares - fearful and suspicious. Her
breathing is heavy.

JAY

Kelly?

Kelly simply nods and smiles reassuringly, shrugging her
shoulders. Of course it's her.
Jay doesn't believe it.
JAY
(still afraid)
Is it really you?!
KELLY
(nodding once again)
Yeah. It's me.
JAY
(relieved)
Ok.

Jay tries to stop herself from crying. She sobs as her sister
comes closer and holds her - leaning down over the bed.

JAY
Does mom know?
KELLY

Yeah. She came earlier.

JAY

How long am I gonna be here?

KELLY
I don't know.

76.
99 CONTINUED: 99

(CONTINUED)

JAY

It's gonna come here. What am I gonna
do?

KELLY

We're gonna figure it out. Just
relax. Ok.
JAY

How far are we from the lake house?

KELLY

Far.

Kelly sits up and yawns, pulling away from the hug. She leans
back revealing -
An OLD NURSE staring down at Jay, a tray of food in her hands.
Jay sees the pale woman and is startled. She immediately
freaks out, pulling away and kicking her food tray to the
floor.

JAY

No! Get her away from me! Can you see
her?! She's right there!

Jay points at the nurse. Kelly tries to calm her sister,
grabbing her arms.

KELLY

I see her! It's just a nurse. She's
bringing you food.
(looking to the nurse)
I'm so sorry... she's really scared.

Jay turns her face toward the pillow. She takes deep breaths.

NURSE

We'll get her something to help her
relax.

JAY
(mumbling)
I don't want anything.

Jay gasps for air.
Everything goes dark... the noises of the hospital warp and
distort...
We hear the sound of Jay breathing.

77.
99 CONTINUED: (2) 99

100 INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DUSK 100
Jay opens her eyes again...
She sees her mother sitting in a nearby chair. The door is
closed.
Paul, Greg, Kelly and Yara lay around the room - scattered in
odd places: chairs, the end of the bed, the window sill.
The television is on, but no one is watching it. It's nothing
but a half-muted light source in an otherwise dim room.
We hear voices - whispering around us. Nothing sounds right.

MRS HEIGHT
(muted)
Was she taking her medicine?

KELLY
(muted)
I don't know. I think so.

Jay begins to cry.
Mrs. Height moves close, holding her hand against her
daughter's forehead.

MRS HEIGHT

Jay, you ok?

Jay's face shows exhaustion and fear. Her crying intensifies.
The young woman sobs and wails like a hurt child. Her mother
holds her, while Kelly wipes tears away from her cheek.

JAY
(whispers)
I don't wanna die.
MRS HEIGHT

You're not gonna die. You're ok. It
was a bad accident. That's all.
You'll be home in a few days.
Jay continues to cry. Greg stares from his seat.

JAY
(whispers)
It's gonna catch me.

Jay sees Greg. She looks to him for help.

78.

(CONTINUED)

JAY
(whispers)
It'll be here soon...

Jay lays against her pillow, sobbing lightly, staring at Greg.
101 EXT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT 101
We watch from outside.
The camera tracks along the exterior of the hospital windows -
past the sleeping and the sick. A man on his deathbed. A
women hobbling to the bathroom. A family laughing silently
behind glass. A child eating over a tray.
We settle on Jay's hospital room - looking in - through the
window from a distance.
Greg leans over the bed, as Jay whispers something into his
ear. A private moment. He nods and says something in reply.
We slowly move closer. A tiny, creeping dolly forward.
They are alone. The room's door is closed.
Greg takes her left hand and holds it.
He kisses her and moves closer. Greg undoes his pants and
pulls them down. Jay lifts the blanket up and pulls her
underwear off.
Greg climbs into the bed with her, touching her body. She
pulls his boxers off and holds him with one arm - keeping her
cast off to the side..
Greg moves on top of Jay. She looks up at him as he positions
himself inside her. Greg stares down at Jay's beautiful face.
102 INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS 102
Jay looks over Greg's shoulder to the closed door. She
watches - waiting - as Greg makes love to her.
Her head and face shake - rising and falling as the young man
moves faster - fucking her harder.
Jay stays focused on the closed door - holding Greg in her
arms.
103 INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT 103
Jay sits alone in her hospital bed. The room is very quiet.
She stares out - lost in thought.
Is it gone?

79.
100 CONTINUED: 100

(CONTINUED)

We sit with Jay for a few moments as she takes a sip of water
and then looks down at her hospital gown. Her legs. The cast
on her arm.
Jay waits for something to happen. She watches the empty
doorway.
104 INT. COLLEGE FOOD COURT - DAY 104
Greg eats a sandwich, fries and coke while chatting with some
girls at a table. Many people cross by.
Greg laughs with his mouth half-full.
105 INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM - DAY 105
Kelly rests on a small couch - magazines on her lap.
Paul sits in a chair - watching across the hallway - looking
into Jay's room. He watches Greg smile and chat with her -
casually eating applesauce from Jay's food tray.
Jay's face is partially hidden by the edge of the doorway.
Paul stares with obvious envy.
106 INT. JAY'S HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS 106
Flowers line the window sill - the sun shines brightly inside.

JAY
You haven't seen it?
GREG
Nothing.

Greg takes another bite of applesauce.

JAY
Really?

GREG
(eating)
Yeah. I'm waiting. Looking. It's
been 3 days...
Jay nods her head - unsure.
GREG

I don't think it's coming.

Jay rests in her hospital bed.

80.
103 CONTINUED: 103

(CONTINUED)

JAY

You believe me right? You're not just
playing along?
GREG
No. I believe you.

Jay nods.

GREG

I just don't think it's... following
me.

Jay stares at Greg. Worried.
GREG
Isn't that good?
JAY

Yeah.

Jay's face doesn't seem relaxed. She takes no comfort in
Greg's words.

JAY

I'm sorry about your car.

GREG
It's just a car.

He smiles and takes one more bite of applesauce - licking the
spoon.
107 EXT. JAY'S BACKYARD - DAY 107
Jay sits in the hot tub, with her cast hanging over the side -
looking out at the neighboring yards. A dullness in her eyes.
The back door is half-open.
A small television rests on the deck - playing the local news.
On the tv: Bodies are carried from a collapsed building. The
news announcer chatters away about the incident.
Jay stares out at her backyard lawn - and the lawns of her
neighbor’s - yards stretching into infinity.
108 INT. JAY'S HOUSE - DAY 108
Jay steps inside her house - drying off with a towel.
It's quiet.
She walks slowly down the hallway to her room.

81.
106 CONTINUED: 106

109 INT. JAY'S ROOM - DAY 109
Opening the bedroom door, Jay notices that her dresser drawer
is open. The underwear drawer.
Looking across the room, she sees her bra, underwear and a
pair of socks laid out across her bed - as though mimicking a
body.
Fear crosses her face.
JAY
Kelly!? Mom!?

No one answers. Jay looks around for an intruder.
Walking towards the bed, Jay passes a dresser, a mirror and
various posters on the wall.
She reaches the bed and picks up her bra. She leans down and
peers out the window.
Nothing.
Standing up, Jay sees a BOY reflected in the mirror. Startled,
she screams - spinning around - falling back against the bed.
It's the 11 year old neighbor boy - hiding against the wall -
panties in his hand. He takes a step forward - arm extending -
worry on his face.

NEIGHBOR BOY

I just wanted to see you. I'm sorry.

JAY
Get out of here!!

The boy drops her underwear on the floor and runs out of the
room - into the hallway.
Jay sits there. Catching her breath.
110 EXT. JAY'S HOUSE - DUSK 110
Kelly and Paul sit on the porch talking, drinking and
listening to music. Near the garage - Yara is chatting with
someone on her pink cell phone.
Greg walks out from his front door. He crosses the street and
approaches the gang on the porch.
GREG
How are you guys?

82.

(CONTINUED)

KELLY

OK.

Paul nods - choosing not to speak.
Yara closes her phone and joins her friends - sitting down
near Paul.

GREG
How's Jay?

Greg looks in the direction of the house - where Jay is. Kelly
shrugs her shoulders.

KELLY
Not great.
PAUL

Have you seen anything?

Paul stares Greg down - letting him know that he knows.
Yara covers her tiny grin - they're all in on it.
Greg silently shakes his head. Nope.
The group is quiet for a moment as they consider this.

GREG

Is it cool if I go in?
KELLY

I don't think so. She doesn't want to
open her door. She's just hiding in
there.

GREG

I thought she'd be doing better.

Greg looks towards the closed doorway. Kelly stares at him -
waiting for something back.
KELLY

I can have her call you later.

GREG
Yeah ok.

Paul watches silently - a brooding stare from the corner of
the porch.

YARA

You really haven't seen anything?

83.
110 CONTINUED: 110

(CONTINUED)

GREG

Nope.

PAUL

She didn't make it up.

GREG

We'll know sooner or later, right?

Greg looks around - thinking about the possibility. He scans
the empty street and the rows of manicured lawns extending
into infinity.

PAUL

That chair cracked in mid-air,
something knocked me over, and the
door... it didn't break on its own.

GREG

Something happened, but... it's not
what she thinks.
KELLY

What do you think it was then?
Greg shrugs his shoulders and steps off the porch.

GREG
I'll see you guys.
KELLY
Bye, Greg.
YARA

Bye.

Greg walks across the street. Paul watches him go - happy to
see him leave.
111 EXT. SUBURBAN PARK - NIGHT 111
The dark trees of the park sway in the night breeze.
112 EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - NIGHT 112
A dog barks from behind a fence. The houses sleep. The
street is quiet.
113 EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT 113
We see the full neighborhood from above.
Scattered house lights and street-lamps form pools of
illumination across the flat Michigan suburbs.

84.
110 CONTINUED: (2) 110

114 INT. JAY'S ROOM - NIGHT 114
Jay sits by her window in pajamas, watching the dark
neighborhood.
Empty yards.
A car passes.
Jay yawns - a hand over her mouth.
Near silence. Some crickets.
Jay sees Greg walking slowly down the sidewalk. He turns and
heads up the path to his house.
Jay knocks on her window, trying to get his attention.
Greg reaches the front door, but it won't open for him.
Jay watches - a bit confused.
Greg picks up a large stone and walks towards the front window
of his house.
Jay realizes something is wrong. She grabs her 80’s handset

phone and dials Greg's number. It goes straight to voice-
mail.

Greg breaks the glass and begins to crawl into his home
through the opening.
Jay leaps up and stumbles out her bedroom door.
115 EXT. GREG'S HOUSE - NIGHT 115
Sprinting to Greg's front yard, Jay pounds on the door - pulls
at the handle.

JAY

Greg! Open the door! Greg!

There's no sound from within. Jay looks to the broken front
window - she runs to it and begins to crawl through.
116 INT. GREG'S HOUSE LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 116
Falling to the carpet, Jay clutches her cast-covered arm and
looks around the dark room. She stands up and moves through
the house.

JAY
(running)
Greg! It's in the house!

85.

(CONTINUED)

We hear a soft and distant tapping from above. A clock chimes.

GREG
(O.S. - distant)
Jesus, mom! I'm sleeping!

Jay runs through a dark hallway reaching the base of the
stairs. She goes up.
116A INT. GREG’S HOUSE UPSTAIRS - CONTINUOUS 116A
Running up the stairs, Jay hears the sound of knocking -
louder. A "tap tap tap" on wood.

JAY
Greg! Watch out!

Reaching the top of the stairwell, Jay stops. Ahead of her,
at Greg's door is his mother, Mrs. Hannigan.
Mrs. Hannigan is knocking on the door. She looks over at Jay
as she continues to knock.
Jay stares - suddenly understanding what's happening.

GREG
(from inside - groggy)

What the fuck is going on? Fucking son-
of-a...

JAY

Greg, it's outside your...!

Greg opens his bedroom door - wearing only boxers. He sees
his mother standing before him in her open bathrobe - breasts
half-exposed.

GREG
(groggy)
What the fuck, mom?

Mrs. Hannigan puts her arms around Greg. Her legs climb up -
feet clawing - wrapping herself around him. He falls backwards
disappearing into the bedroom.
Jay circles the doorway, looking in. She sees the woman
straddling Greg, holding tightly as he convulses - his eyes
rolled back - revealing white and veins. A fallen lamp
flickers and strobes. The room appears to shake.
The mother pushes herself against Greg - bare legs - a loose
robe - indecent. His hand struggles against hers - their
fingers intertwined.

86.
116 CONTINUED: 116

(CONTINUED)

A heavy rush of fluid pours down onto Greg’s boxers - soaking
the carpet.
The young man stops moving. He's dead and pale - his tongue
edging out the side of his mouth.
The thing looks back at Jay and stands. It begins to follow
her as she backs up along the hall landing - down the stairs.
Jay runs to the front door - fleeing the house.
117 INT. JAY'S CAR - NIGHT 117
Jay pulls out of her driveway wildly. She drives down the
street as Greg walks out of his front door - staring at her.
118 INT. JAY'S CAR - NIGHT 118
Jay cruises along the expressway. She tries to slow her
breathing. She wipes some tears from her face.
119 INT. JAY'S CAR - NIGHT 119
The radio is on. A beautiful pop song plays from the
speakers. Jay is tired as she steers along the near empty
expressway.
120 INT. JAY'S CAR - NIGHT 120
Quiet now. Heading down a rural highway.
Jay pulls her car into a long dirt drive. She follows the
tree-lined path deeper.
121 EXT. WOODS - NIGHT 121
Jay parks and gets out of her car along the edge of some light
woods. She moves around the car and climbs over the front
fender, sitting on the hood.
Jay lays back and stares up at the night sky. She turns her
head and watches the empty road - illuminated by a lone street
lamp. She waits.
122 EXT. WOODS - DAWN 122
Jay sits on the roof of her car, facing the road. She stares
out at the empty path.
She hears something. A sputtering engine. Voices in the
distance.
Jay climbs down and follows the sound through the trees -
toward the rising sun.

87.
116A CONTINUED: 116A

123 EXT. CLEARING AT LAKE - DAWN 123
Stepping out of the woods, Jay finds herself along the edge of
Lake St. Claire. She looks out at the deep waters as a
motorboat slows in the distance.
A few shirtless YOUNG MEN drink beer in the boat as it rocks
and sways. Listening to music, they don't notice the young
woman on shore.
Jay focuses on the men. A thought crosses her eyes.
Jay takes off her pants and shirt as she steps into the lake.
She moves out, bracing herself against the cold - letting her
cast drop carelessly into the water.
She swims further. The boat is ahead. The young men grow
closer and closer.
Jay slows and stops. She's near the boat now. The music and
laughter is louder. She looks up at the figures of men -
considering. She starts to call out, but stops. Her eyes
show melancholy as she paddles in place.
I can't do this.
Jay exhales and drops down into the water.
She's gone.
We sit on the surface of the lake watching the young men on
the boat drink and laugh. Eventually, they start the engine
and cruise off along the horizon.
A flock of birds fly overhead.
The water is still.
Jay pops up several yards away - nearly out of frame - gasping
for air. She fights to swim back.
124 EXT. JAY'S HOUSE - MORNING 124
Jay drives the car down her street - her hair still damp - the
cast soaking wet. As she pulls into her driveway, she sees
Kelly and Yara sitting on the porch - haggard and sad.
125 INT. JAY'S BEDROOM - DAY 125
Jay is resting on the floor of the darkened room. A towel is

wrapped around her cast. Some light peeks in through the half-
drawn shades. Kelly and Yara are sleeping on the bed - passed

out - a space of mourning.
Yara snores a little.

88.

(CONTINUED)

The old sandwich sits untouched on its plate. The bread has
grown moldy. The pickle is dry. The Doritos remain orange and
unchanged.
The television is on. Old commercials sell products. *
There's a knock at the door. Jay opens her eyes.

JAY
Who is it?
PAUL

Paul.

JAY
Hang on.

Jay gets up and pulls the chair away from the door, she
cautiously opens it, peeking out into the hallway. She sees
Paul - alone.
He steps into the room. Jay quickly closes the door and
barricades it.
Paul sits down on the floor next to Jay's nest of blankets and
clothes. She sits alongside him, pulling her t-shirt down as
she stretches her legs across the blanket with little regard
for modesty. Her focus is singular - a melancholy has settled
in her eyes.
They sit in silence together for a moment. Yara's snoring
quietly rattles from the mattress.

JAY

It's gonna be here sooner or later.

Paul takes a breath - he's thought about it. He speaks in
whispers.

PAUL
You could pass it on.

Jay shakes her head. She won't. Not again.

PAUL
You did once.
JAY
I shouldn't have.

Jay looks ahead at the black dress slung over her chair.

PAUL
I could...

89.
125 CONTINUED: 125

(CONTINUED)

Jay looks at Paul - direct eye contact.

JAY

No.

A moment passes. Paul stares at Jay's profile. She watches
the window.

PAUL

I liked you too, ya know.

Jay takes a breath, fidgeting with her t-shirt. She knows.

PAUL

Why did you pick Greg?

Jay looks down at her legs. She pulls them closer to her
chest - she taps her knee lightly.

JAY

I thought he would be ok.
(beat)
He wasn't scared.

Paul listens.

JAY

We slept together in high school. It
wasn't a big deal.

Paul nods - not agreeing but feeling the need to respond
somehow.
He leans in and starts to kiss Jay. She pulls away
immediately.
Paul reaches over and touches Jay’s fingers - extended just
beyond the edge of the damp cast. She maintains her gaze on
the window - with a soft sigh - exhaling tension.

PAUL
I wanna help you.

Paul caresses Jay's hand. She stares off - disconnected from
his touch.

JAY
Do you?

PAUL
Yeah. I do.
Jay pulls her hand away slowly.

90.
125 CONTINUED: (2) 125

(CONTINUED)

Paul takes a deep breath. He looks around the dim room. It's *
messy now. Clothes are scattered.
A dirty and tangled shirt hangs from the hamper. A bra sits
on the floor - half covered by a dirty tennis shoe.
Kelly's hand hangs from the edge of the bed.
Jay crawls over to the window and peeks out. She watches the
street through the low hanging branches of the trees as they
sway. A kid rides past the house on his bike.
Greg's front window is covered with plywood. There’s a police
car parked in his driveway. Jay begins to cry - she’s given
up.
Paul watches her - crouched and scared at the window's edge.
He notices her underwear at the bottom of her taut shirt.
The young man looks away in frustration. A deep exhale. He *
holds his gaze against the far wall - noticing an old photo *
taped to the mirror. *
It’s a picture of he and Jay - younger - standing together *
with wet hair and bathing suits by an old indoor pool. Smiling *
- beers in hand. *
PAUL *
Jay? *
JAY *
(still staring out the *
window) *
Yeah? *
PAUL *
Do you trust me? *
Jay nods and turns to Paul - ready to hear. *
PAUL *
Well... do you remember where we were *
the first time we kissed? *
Jay nods yes. *
126 INT. JAY'S CAR - LATE DAY 126
Jay climbs into the passenger seat - behind her we see Yara *
and Kelly getting into the back and putting on their seat *
belts. Paul closes the trunk and climbs into the driver’s *
seat. *
Outside, the neighbor boys are playing ball in the front yard.
They steal glances towards the car and Jay.

91.
125 CONTINUED: (3) 125

(CONTINUED)

KELLY *
You know where to go? *
PAUL *

I know how to get there. Mostly.

KELLY *

Alright.
YARA

I haven't been to the pool since I was
14.

PAUL *

Who brought you?

Yara kicks Paul’s seat - not smiling. *
PAUL *

Ok.

Paul starts the car and begins to back up. He throws his arm *
over the passenger seat and guides the car backwards. Music
plays from the radio.
As the car reverses, we see more and more of Jay's house - the
roof is revealed. Jay is looking the opposite way.
An OLD NAKED MAN is standing on the roof - looking down at
Jay. No one sees him.
KELLY

That's where I had my first beer. I
threw up that whole night.

YARA
Into the pool?
KELLY
No. Outside the car.
PAUL
And in the car.
YARA

Ewwww.

Paul backs up to the edge of the driveway - waiting for cars *
to pass.

KELLY

Paul used to pee in it.

YARA
Disgusting.

92.
126 CONTINUED: 126

(CONTINUED)

PAUL

Not really. Whatever. There’s
chlorine.

Jay glances back towards her house...
On the roof, she sees the naked, wrinkled man with red hair
standing on the edge - staring at her. He's fully upright,
shoulders out, standing on the roof. He doesn't move. He
just watches her.
Jay holds her breath in fear.
Paul pulls into the street and puts the car in drive. *
Jay’s view shifts as the car lurches around - rides the bump
of the soft curb.
Paul accelerates and guides the car down the street. *
Jay turns away and stares ahead - tears in her eyes.
127 EXT. JAY'S CAR - DAY 127
We speed along Interstate 75 - going south. We see only the
road racing towards us - scenery changing.
The hum of the car engine.
Deeper and deeper into the city we drive.
Passing exit signs for mile roads. Ducking under rotting
overpasses.
Broken buildings wave from the edge of the expressway. Gutted
plants momentarily block out the harsh sun.
Dangerous streets and alleyways loom along their path.
The camera slowly rotates around, pointing back through the
front windshield - revealing Paul behind the wheel. Jay sits *
in the passenger seat. Kelly and Yara are in the back. The *
kids are solemn and quiet. The hum of the road is hypnotizing
- tiring.
They sit in silence as they drive on.
128 EXT. DETROIT STREET - DUSK 128
Storefronts, boarded houses, rotting factories and empty lots
fill the frame.
Jay's car is parked along a fence near a boarded store-front.
We move through the poor neighborhood - slowly.

93.
126 CONTINUED: (2) 126

(CONTINUED)

Jay and the girls follow Paul - looking out at the half empty
neighborhood.
Paul carries a large duffle bag over his shoulder - a small *
television in hand. The girls have backpacks. Yara lugs an old *
boom-box. *

YARA

When I was a little girl my parents
told me I wasn't allowed to go south
of 8 mile. I didn't even understand
what that meant. It wasn't until I
got a little older that I realized
that was where the city started and
the suburbs ended. I started thinking
how weird and shitty that was. I had
to ask permission to go to the state
fair with my best friend and her
parents just because it was a few
blocks past the border.

JAY

My parents said the same thing to me.

Everything is bare - revealed in the fading sunlight. A few
young men hang-out on the street. They watch the kids as they
pass.
A homeless man shuffles closer.
129 EXT. OLD POOL BUILDING - NIGHT 129
Small figures in the darkness, Jay and her friends walk up to
a large stone structure at the edge of an inner-city
neighborhood.
Paul pulls open a loose window and begins to crawl inside.
130 INT. OLD POOL BUILDING - NIGHT 130
The gang steps into a large indoor pool room. An enormous and
ornate ceiling frames the giant swimming pool spanning the
length of the building. It’s dark except for a few dim pool
lights and the glow from the upper story windows.
Water reflections cross Jay’s face as she steps to the

poolside - kneeling down along the tile in her shorts and t-
shirt - bedclothes for a warm night.

PAUL

How long do you think it will be?

Jay shakes her head.

94.
128 CONTINUED: 128

(CONTINUED)

JAY

I don't know. Hours I bet.

Jay dips her hand into the water and looks deeply through the
walls of the room - beyond the water and the brick.

PAUL

It's been a long time since we were
here together.

Jay nods her head, splashing the water gently.

PAUL

You kissed me right over there... I
think.

JAY

Is that how you remember it?

PAUL

Uh huh.

Jay raises her brow - a sad smile on her face.
Across the way, Kelly and Yara stretch out in the shifting *
shadows of the pool.
131 EXT. CITY - NIGHT 131
Rain clouds fill the skyline, changing the nature of the
moonlit city.
132 INT. OLD POOL BUILDING - NIGHT 132
Paul pulls household irons, curlers and a radio from his
duffle bag - rolls of extensions cords.
Jay empties her backpack onto the ground. Yara places a small *
television near the edge of the pool.
The girls string electrical cords across doorways, and under
chairs toward the water.
Plugging in tattered cords to dusty outlets.
Along the edge of the room, Paul digs through a utility closet
- unearthing an old space heater.
132A INT. OLD POOL BUILDING - NIGHT 132A
Extension cords stretch and snake across the tile floor - all
leading to various small appliances placed precariously along
the edges of the pool. Irons, curlers, radios and a tv - all
turned on. Quiet static and heat.

95.
130 CONTINUED: 130

(CONTINUED)

Jay sits, scanning the area, waiting for it. Eyes steady on *
the entrance.
Yara stands further back - arms crossed - scuffing her shoes *
nervously along the ground. She looks over at Jay with *
sympathetic eyes. *
Paul sits quietly. Kelly paces near the windows. *
Jay stares down at the ground, moving her fingers across the
grout and the tile.
They wait. *
132B OMITTED 132B
133 EXT. OLD POOL BUILDING - NIGHT 133
We see the old building. Static. Quiet.
Thunder rumbles in the distance.
Lightning strikes beyond the tree-line - small wiry lines of
light in the ink-washed sky.
A few drops of rain begin to fall. Gentle on the concrete.
Calm like the sound of waves.
133A INT. OLD POOL BUILDING - NIGHT 133A
Now wearing her bathing suit - Jay climbs slowly down the
ladder into the pool. Adjusting to the feel of water in
darkness.
Alone in this large body of water. Her friends watching from
the edges.
The sound of rainfall on windows - mixed with the gentle slosh
and tapping of pool water.
Lightning strikes in the distance. A faint flash inside.
Jay stands alone in the center of the pool, looking around at
the flickering shadows along the walls. Vulnerable.
134 EXT. OLD POOL BUILDING - NIGHT 134
We see rain drops falling in an off-rhythm pattern against the
metal fence. The doors to the building are visible in the
background.
The rain begins to pour. Picking up pace. Rattling softly
into the wild grass along the edge of the building.
We see various angles of increasing rainfall.

96.
132A CONTINUED: 132A

134A OMITTED 134A
135 OMITTED 135
136 INT. OLD POOL BUILDING - NIGHT 136
Jay waits, alone in the pool - focused on the main entrance.
Everyone is silent. She listens to the sounds of rain... and
the soft clatter of unseen machinery. Air ducts and pool pumps
reverberate.
Jay scans the doorways - turning lightly within the water.
Watching. Tense.
Shadows flicker along the walls. The reflections of water
against stone.
The camera pans across the giant space. The teenagers pose
like figures within a grander painting. Positions have
shifted minimally.
Kelly sits near the pool’s edge - leaning back on her hands -
palms flat against the cold and wet tile.
Rain falls against one of the high windows - through which
outside light enters - creating descending drops of shadow
across the room.
Paul leans against the side wall - watching - rubbing his
injured side casually over his t-shirt.
Across the way, Yara rests in one of the metal folding chairs,
chewing on licorice - a foot tucked under a leg.
Kelly looks to her sister, alone in the pool as she turns and
pivots. Seeing her older sister - afraid in this dark room -
Kelly tries to hold in her sadness.
Positioned behind Kelly, we watch Jay from a distance as she
stares into the emptiness - waiting for something to enter.

JAY
(quietly)
Oh my God.

Jay looks like she's about to cry. She sees something
terrible, although the area appears empty.

JAY

It just walked into the room. It's
right there.

Jay points over to the entrance. We see nothing.

97.

(CONTINUED)

PAUL
It's here?
JAY
Right there!

Jay points again. Her voice pitches awkwardly. She starts to
cry.
Holding still, we watch the scene from behind Kelly's
shoulder.

KELLY

Jay... what... do you see?

Jay just stares ahead, seeing something we do not.

JAY

I don’t wanna tell you.

PAUL

Jay, I need you to point at it. Keep
your finger aimed at it so we can see
where it is.

In a single wide shot - Jay lifts her left hand and aims it
across the room - tracking the thing.

PAUL

Is it getting into the water?

JAY

No. It’s just standing there - looking
at me.

Kelly looks to Paul - concerned.
PAUL
Ok... um...
JAY
It’s moving.

Jay turns slowly, her arm stretched out, pointing at the
invisible thing. - tracking with it around the far corner of
the pool.

YARA
(frightened)
What’s it doing?
JAY

Walking. Walking closer.

98.
136 CONTINUED: 136

(CONTINUED)

Jay continues to pivot in the water, stepping back from the
edge nearest her invisible pursuer. Creating distance.
As Jay points along the pool’s side, Yara steps back
cautiously, bumping into some chairs - moving away from IT’s
path.

JAY

Paul, I wanna get out.

PAUL

Just wait. Give it a minute.

JAY

No, I don’t wanna do this. I just
wanna get out of the water.

Suddenly a metal folding-chair rises six feet in the air. It
moves back and then flies into the pool with force - straight
at Jay.
Splash!

KELLY

Jay!

Jay jumps to the side, avoiding the chair as it sinks to the
bottom. *
Water swirls around us as we surface. Jay splashes and lifts
her head for air. She sees a NEARLY-NAKED MIDDLE-AGED MAN WITH
SALT AND PEPPER HAIR walking along the perimeter of the pool.
He’s staring at her, wearing nothing but underwear.
The man grabs another chair and throws it at Jay. She dives to
the side and dodges it. Falling deeper into the water.
Coughing and gasping.
JAY

Help!

Paul, Kelly and Yara circle the pool, reaching out for Jay -
waving for her to swim in their direction. Screaming -
shouting.
Jay rushes toward the edge. It throws another chair at her - *
striking her in the shoulder - causing her to fall below the *
water. *

KELLY

No!

Jay surfaces, holding herself in pain. *
99.
136 CONTINUED: (2) 136

(CONTINUED)

She sees the man pick up a small television - still connected *
to the outlet by an extension cord. He prepares to throw it -
offering her an odd smile.
Jay braces herself for a shock, covering her face from the
projectile. The tv flies through the air - hurled recklessly.

KELLY

Jay!!!!

The tv misses Jay, but splashes down nearby - pulling with it
the slack from the orange extension cord.
The outside lights flicker, but there are no sparks. No smoke.
Jay is ok.
She looks back, realizing she’s still alive and breathing.

KELLY

You OK?
JAY

Yeah.

YARA *
(smiling with relief) *
It didn’t work.
KELLY
Thank Godddd.
PAUL
(to Jay))
Just keep pointing at it!

Jay paddles, pointing at the man while crying - trying to
catch her breath. Yara and Kelly hover in the background,
screaming and shouting for information.

KELLY
Where is it?!

Paul clumsily pulls the pistol from his bag, and runs in the
direction that Jay’s pointing. He aims the gun along the edge
of the pool walkway. We see no monsters. No strange men.
An old set of pink electric curlers fly into the water -
kicked by something unseen.
SPLASH!!
Paul fires in the general direction of the curlers - taking a *
guess.
BANG!!

100.
136 CONTINUED: (3) 136

(CONTINUED)

JAY
You missed it!
PAUL
Where is it?

For an instant we see IT from Jay's POV. The man stares at
her, but swings his hand out at Paul, reaching for him with a
violent shake and tremor.
JAY

Watch out! Don't get too close.

The man throws another old appliance into the water, straight *
at Jay. It misses her as the cord drops below the surface.
Yara circles, keeping her distance from the approaching IT.
Paul moves back and tries to aim. Once more, we see things
from his POV: Jay madly pointing her finger from within the
water.

JAY
It's there!

Paul fires again. Across the pool, the bullet slices into
Yara's leg.

YARA

Ahhh.

Yara falls onto the ground - unnoticed by everyone.

JAY
No! It... missed!
PAUL
Where?! Here?! Here?
JAY
No! Right there!

Jay swings her hand, trying to direct the weapon by proxy.
Paul tries to slowly adjust the direction of his gun.
The man grabs a household iron from the edge of the pool.
Paul fires. Yara screams in fright.
BANG!
Jay sees the shot connect with the man’s left thumb and index
finger - severing them. The flesh flies off and drops into the
pool. Blood spouts.

101.
136 CONTINUED: (4) 136

(CONTINUED)

Kelly pulls an old bed-sheet from her backpack. Gaudy colors,
swirling roses and a few large stains.
She unfolds the sheet, whipping it across the air. As it
drifts down, a stain is visible across the center.
With his right hand, the man hurls the iron into the water -
hitting Jay’s side below the surface. She crumples. *
Paul tries to find a target. *

PAUL
Where is it?!

Moving along the pool’s edge, Kelly flags the sheet outward,
letting it drift. It catches on something. She lets go and
drops it down. The sheet collects over the moving figure of a
man - revealing the thing walking amongst them. A person under
an old worn sheet.
Yara gasps at the sight of it - shuffling past her.
Paul tries to steady his aim. He fires at IT.
BANG!
Jay watches as a shot slices through the man’s head - covered
by the old sheet. The bullet emerges from the other side.
Blood sprays like vapor - constant and strong.
The impact causes the man to stumble forward. The geyser of
blood from his head tips with him. He falls into the pool - no
emotion - no pain.
SPLASH!!! *
The sheet spreads along the surface, dropping down at the
edges - waterlogged.
Jay quickly wades through the water toward Paul, Kelly and
Yara - hands outstretched at the side of the pool.
Almost there... something pulls Jay below the surface.
Underwater - a hand is grasped tightly around Jay’s ankle. She
kicks and fights.
Gasping for air... there’s only water... Jay thrashes and
struggles.
Snaking extension cords - orange, white and brown - lead down *
into the depths of the water - anchored by small domestic *
appliances - a toaster, a television, irons, curlers and metal *
chairs - dotting the bottom - littering the pool. *
102.
136 CONTINUED: (5) 136

(CONTINUED)

Kelly and Paul’s POV - they watch as Jay is pulled deeper
underwater - kicking and fighting against nothing.
Yara wails loudly nearby.
Paul raises the gun toward the water. *
Jay’s POV - Jay continues to struggle underwater. The man *
holds her tightly by the ankle. We watch from a distance, the *
debris of appliances and wires framing their fight. *
A bullet trail forms through the water, zipping past Jay and *
the man. *
Then another. *
A third trail strikes the man in the back, releasing a large *
swirl of blood. He let’s go of Jay and she swims upward. *
Paul and Kelly pull Jay from the water, dragging her onto the *
ground. Coughing and choking, she crawls further along the
tile - in terrible pain.
Her ankle is covered in a red rash.
Jay sits, soaking wet, on the floor, clutching her ankle - her
cast hangs limp to her side.
A moment of silence. Coughing and crying.
Kelly holds tightly to Yara's bleeding leg. *
We hear the rain on the windows and some thunder claps above. *
Paul looks down into the clear pool water - seeing only the *
extension cords and household objects. We don’t see the IT nor *
its blood. *
PAUL *
Jay, do you see it? Is it still down *
there? *
Jay peers over the edge. *
We watch from above as Jay stares down into the pool. Instead *
of water, we see only deep red blood. Everything below the *
surface is obscured by the dense liquid. *
A pool of blood. *
As Jay stares in horror, we hear a cacophony of sounds - *
screeches and sirens - laughter and grunting - a birthing *
scream - children yelling - her mother’s laughter... *

140 INT. PAUL'S BASEMENT REC ROOM - NIGHT 140
A chair is propped against the door. *
Jay and Paul are laying on the couch - an old blanket covering
their bodies.
Jay looks into his eyes and waits for a sign. He nods his head
with love and anticipation.
Jay moves on top of him - sitting up, pulling the blanket over
herself. They fumble underneath and begin to make love.
Paul nervously touches her face. Staring up lovingly.
She kisses him - holding her cast to her side.
They stare into each others eyes. For the first time they are
thinking only of each other.
A moment of connection through the physical. Rain against the
basement window.
They move slowly with pleasure.
JAY

I feel like I’m hurting you.

Paul looks up at her.
PAUL
You’re not.
Jay nods and continues.
She pushes harder against him - exhaling - smiling down at
him.
Paul stares at Jay’s face.
We watch from across the room now. The quiet basement. A
thunderstorm outside. The young lovers on an old couch.
140A INT. PAUL’S BASEMENT REC ROOM - NIGHT 140A
Wrapped in the blanket, holding each other, Jay and Paul rest.
Faces close together. Whispering.
PAUL

Do you feel any different?

Jay shakes her head. No.
JAY
Do you?

PAUL

No.
Jay kisses Paul.
137 INT. JAY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 137
Jay lays under her sheets - a cartoon bandaid across her
temple - a new cast on her arm. Mrs. Height sits on the edge
of the bed, rubbing her back. Softly.
On the dresser, we see a glass of wine and an old family
portrait. Jay is a young girl. Kelly is a baby. Their
mother, young and pretty smiles alongside Jay's father, a
middle-aged man with salt and pepper hair. He grins happily
into the camera. His smile is identical to the one he offered
Jay at the pool.
142 INT. PAUL'S CAR - DUSK 142 *
Paul drives through a run-down neighborhood within the inner *
city. He stares at a row of prostitutes. Tight skirts. *
Revealing tops. *
They eye him. Paul watches them as he passes. The women *
appear to move in slow motion. *
138 INT. HOSPITAL - DAY 138
Jay sits across from Paul in Yara’s hospital room. He lays *
back in a chair - eyes closed and napping. *
Yara is eating in bed, as she reads something from her phone.

YARA
(reading with food in
her mouth)
"When there is torture there is pain
and wounds, physical agony, and all
this distracts the mind from mental
suffering, so that one is tormented
only by the wounds until the moment of
death."

Yara pauses to take a sip of milk through a straw - noisily
she slurps.

105.
140A CONTINUED: 140A

YARA
(taking a bite of food)
"The most terrible agony may not be in
the wounds themselves but in knowing
for certain that within an hour, then
within ten minutes, then within half a
minute, now at this very instant -
your soul will leave your body and you
will no longer be a person, and that
this is certain; the worst thing is
that it is certain."

Jay looks at Paul's handsome face. She tilts her head a bit - *
watching the young man at rest. *
Yara takes another large bite of food.

141A INT. OLD POOL BUILDING - DAY 141A
Several groups of inner-city children laugh and play in the
clean water of the old pool. The rumble of the sound-track
suggests something ominous.
143 EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAWN 143
Beyond the barren trees of the middle-class suburban
neighborhood, the concrete towers of a nuclear power plant are
visible in the distance. Smoke rises.
144 EXT. PARK - NIGHT 144
Blue light from distant lamps shines a cold glow over the
empty park. The trees are now barren.
145 EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY 145
Dead but colorful leaves cover the ground. We move forward
along the sidewalk.
Up ahead, a man rakes his front yard. A few children build a
fort out of the fallen leaves. Lines of red and orange across
the grass.
Jay and Paul hold hands as they walk together through the
neighborhood. The cast is gone.
Far behind them, a teenager in a coat marches slowly along the
edge of the road.
Jay smiles to Paul and he smiles back. They stare out at the
autumnal suburbia - pretty and clean.
